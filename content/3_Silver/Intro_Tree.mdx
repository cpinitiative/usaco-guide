<Spoiler title="Some common terms relating to trees">
 -->

Some properties/definitions of trees:

- A graph is a **tree** iff it is connected and contains $N$ nodes and $N-1$
  edges
- A graph is a **tree** iff every pair of nodes has exactly one simple path
  between them
- A graph is a **tree** iff it is connected and does not contain any cycles

General Tree Terminology:

- A **leaf** of a tree is any node in the tree with degree $1$
  - If the tree is rooted, the **root** with a single child is _not_ typically
    considered a leaf, but depending on the problem, this is not always the case
- A **star graph** has two common definitions. Try to understand what they
  mean - they typically appear in subtasks.
  - Definition 1: Only one node has degree greater than $1$
  - Definition 2: Only one node has degree greater than $2$
- A **forest** is a graph such that each **connected component** is a tree

Rooted Tree Terminology:

- A **root** of a tree is any node of the tree that is considered to be at the
  'top'
- A **parent** of a node $n$ is the first node along the path from $n$ to the
  **root**
  - The **root** does not have a **parent**. This is typically done in code by
    setting the **parent** of the **root** to be $-1$.
- The **ancestors** of a node are its **parent** and **parent's** **ancestors**
  - Typically, a node is considered its own ancestor as well (such as in the
    subtree definition)
- The **subtree** of a node $n$ are the set of nodes that have $n$ as an
  ancestor
  - A node is typically considered to be in its own subtree
  - Note: This is easily confused with **subgraph**
- The **depth**, or **level**, of a node is its distance from the root

## Solution - Subordinates

<!-- Typically, after arbitrarily rooting a tree, some interesting pieces of information are a node's parent, subtree size, and depth.  -->

In this problem we are given the parent of each node of a rooted tree, and we
want to compute the subtree size for each node. A subtree is composed of a root
node and the subtrees of the root's children. Thus, the size of a subtree is one
plus the size of the root's childrens' subtrees.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int SZ = 2e5;

vector<int> children[SZ];
int subtree_size[SZ], depth[SZ];

void dfs_size(int node) {
	subtree_size[node] = 1; // This one represents the root of `node's` subtree
	// (which would be `node` itself)
	for (int child : children[node]) {
		depth[child] = depth[node]+1; // not needed for this problem
		dfs_size(child);
		subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child];
		// Add `node's` children's subtrees to the size of `node's` subtree
	}
}

int main() {
	int N; cin >> N;
	for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
		int parent; cin >> parent; parent--;
		// this node is the parent of node i ... Also notice
		// the decrement operator in order to make the node 0-indexed
		children[parent].push_back(i);
	}
	dfs_size(0);
	for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		cout << subtree_size[i]-1;
		if(i != N-1) cout << " ";
	}
	cout << "\n";
}

```

<JavaSection>

<Warning>

Because Java is so slow, an adjacency list using lists/arraylists results in
TLE. Instead, the Java sample code will use the
[Chinese edge representation](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/67883).

</Warning>

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Subordinates
{
	static InputReader in = new InputReader(System.in);
	static PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);

	public static final int MN = 200020;

	static int N, M, ans;
	static int[] hd = new int[MN], nx = new int[MN], to = new int[MN], s = new int[MN], p = new int[MN];

	public static void adde(int u, int v, int id)
	{
		nx[id] = hd[u];
		hd[u] = id;
		to[id] = v;
	}
	public static void dfs(int node)
	{
		s[node]=1;
		for(int id=hd[node];id!=0;id=nx[id])
		{
			dfs(to[id]);
			s[node]+=s[to[id]];
		}
	}
	public static void main(String... args)
	{
		N=in.nextInt();
		for(int i=2;i<=N;++i)
		{
			p[i]=in.nextInt();
			adde(p[i], i, i);
		}
		dfs(1);
		for(int i=1;i<=N;++i)
		{
			out.print(s[i]-1);
			if(i<N) out.print(" ");
			else out.println();
		}
		out.close();
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

In the Python solution, we need to set recursion limit to $2\times10^5$.

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(200006) # set recursion limit
def dfs(x): # x is the current node
	ans = 0 # stores the number of subordinates
	for e in edges[x]:
		if e != fa[x-1]:
			ans += dfs(e)
	sub[x-1] = ans # 0-index is more convenient for printing
	return ans+1 # add the node x itself
N = int(input())
edges = [[] for _ in range(N+1)] # create empty adjacency list
sub = [0 for _ in range(N)] # the number of subordinates
fa = [1] + list(map(int, input().split())) # the parent of each node, set the parent of node 1 to itself
for ind, f in enumerate(fa):
	edges[f].append(ind+1) # add edges to the adjacency list
dfs(1)
for i in sub:
	print(i, end=" ")
```

## Computing parent, depth, and subtree sizes

The following sample code computes the **parent**, **depth**, and **subtree sizes** of each node of a tree, assuming node 1 is the root.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
//Not Tested
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

const int MN = 2e5+10;
std::vector<int> a[MN];
int p[MN], d[MN], s[MN];
void dfs(int n)
{
	s[n]=1;
	for(int x:a[n])
		if(x!=p[n])
		{
			d[x]=d[n]+1;
			p[x]=n;
			dfs(x);
			s[n]+=s[x];
		}
}
int main()
{
	for(int i=0,x,y;i+1<N;++i)
		scanf("%d%d", &x, &y), a[x].push_back(y), a[y].push_back(x);
	p[0]=-1;
	d[0]=0;
	dfs(1);
	//do something

## Quiz
<Quiz>
	<Quiz.Question>
		How is a preorder traversal found for a binary tree?
		<Quiz.Answer correct>
			Add the current node to the list, and then run DFS on all child nodes of the current node from left to right.
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Correct! Adding the current node first is preorder traversal. Adding it between the two child nodes is inorder, and adding it after the two child nodes is postorder.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			Run DFS on the left node, add the current node to the list, and then run DFS on the right node.
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Incorrect. This is inorder traversal.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			Run DFS on the right node, add the current node to the list, and then run DFS on the left node.
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Incorrect. This is neither preorder, inorder, or postorder traversal.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			Run DFS on all child nodes of the current node from left to right, then add the current node to the list.
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Incorrect. This is postorder traversal.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
	</Quiz.Question>
	<Quiz.Question>
		What is the diameter of a tree?
		<Quiz.Answer>
			The length of the longest path from root to leaf node
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				False. The diameter of a tree is the maximum distance between two nodes, which usually isn't the longest distance between the root and the leaf. The only exception is if the root is a leaf along the longest path of a tree.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			The length of the longest path that exists in the tree
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				This statement is true, but 3 is also true.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			The length of the longest path from two leaf nodes
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				This statement is true, but 2 is also true.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer correct>
			Both 2 and 3
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Correct! The diameter is the longest path between two nodes in a tree, but the longest path must be a path between two leaf nodes. If we have a path between two nodes that are not leaves, it can't be the longest because we can extend our path further down the tree in either direction.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
	</Quiz.Question>
	<Quiz.Question>
		What would be a valid function header for DFS on an undirected tree to work in linear time *without* any other variables?
		<Quiz.Answer correct>
			`void dfs(int v, int p, vector<vector<int>>& adj)`
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Correct! For a tree, we do not need a visited array. We only need to check if we are revisiting the parent node, so `v` as a current node and `p` as a parent node would work.

				Calling `adj` as a `vector<vector<int>>&` instead of just `vector<vector<int>>` ensures that the reference (instead of the entire list) is copied over each time, which takes constant instead of linear time. Therefore, the entire DFS would take linear time.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			`void dfs(int v, int p, vector<vector<int>> adj)`
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Incorrect. This would not work in linear time because `adj` would be copied in $O(n)$ time every time DFS is called. As DFS is called $n$ times, this runs in $O(n^2)$.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			`void dfs(int v, vector<vector<int>> adj)`
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Incorrect. This DFS function cannot check for a parent node, and therefore would never terminate.
			</Quiz.Explanation>
		</Quiz.Answer>
		<Quiz.Answer>
			`void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& adj)`
			<Quiz.Explanation>
				Incorrect. This DFS function cannot track the current node, therefore it cannot even run.
