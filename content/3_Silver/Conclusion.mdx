## What Now?

After completing this section on the USACO Guide, you should be comfortable with
the topics that have historically appeared in the USACO Silver
division.<Asterisk>Of course, there's always a chance that another topic,
potentially from a higher division, will show up in future Silver
contests.</Asterisk> In order to maximize your chance at promoting, you should
aim to **practice** by doing more problems.

## Uncategorized Problems

Below we list some problems that we think are roughly Silver level but don't
really fit in previous modules.<Asterisk>either because there were too many
problems already, or because the problem requires more than one
concept</Asterisk> The difficulties listed here are relative to the Silver
division (difficulty is subjective and isn't always accurate though). We'll be
expanding this list as we get more problem suggestions.
