## Introduction

</Resources>

A **priority queue** (or **heap**) supports the following operations: insertion
of elements, deletion of the element considered highest priority, and retrieval
of the highest priority element, all in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time according to
the number of elements in the priority queue. Priority queues are simpler and
faster than sets, so you should use them instead whenever possible.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

### [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/priority_queue/)

```cpp
priority_queue<int> pq;
pq.push(7);                // [7]
pq.push(2);                // [2, 7]
pq.push(1);                // [1, 2, 7]
pq.push(5);                // [1, 2, 5, 7]
cout << pq.top() << endl;  // 7
pq.pop();                  // [1, 2, 5]
pq.pop();                  // [1, 2]
pq.push(6);                // [1, 2, 6]
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

### Java

In Java (unlike in C++), we delete and retrieve the **lowest** element.

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
pq.add(7);                      // [7]
pq.add(2);                      // [7, 2]
pq.add(1);                      // [7, 2, 1]
pq.add(5);                      // [7, 5, 2, 1]
System.out.println(pq.peek());  // 1
pq.poll();                      // [7, 5, 2]
pq.poll();                      // [7, 5]
pq.add(6);                      // [7, 6, 5]
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

### [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)

In Python (unlike in C++), we delete and retrieve the **lowest** element.

Note that Python's priority queue is not encapsulated; `heapq` operates on a
provided list directly by turning it into a heap, then doing operations on the
heap.

<Warning>

Because of a heap's structure, printing out `pq` will **not** print out the
elements in sorted order in Python; instead, it will print out the list. The
comments below are a **representation** of what the heap contains, **not** what
the contents of `pq` actually are.

</Warning>

```py
import heapq

pq = []

"""
The following line is not necessary since pq starts as an empty list. However,
for lists of length greater than 1, heapify is required to turn the list into a
heap.
"""
heapq.heapify(pq)

heapq.heappush(pq, 7)  # [7]
heapq.heappush(pq, 2)  # [7, 2]
heapq.heappush(pq, 1)  # [7, 2, 1]
heapq.heappush(pq, 5)  # [7, 5, 2, 1]
print(pq[0])  # 1
heapq.heappop(pq)  # [7, 5, 2]
heapq.heappop(pq)  # [7, 5]
heapq.heappush(pq, 6)  # [7, 6, 5]
```

## Example

<FocusProblem problem="sample" />

### Solution

In this problem, we're asked the minimum number of rooms needed to accommodate
$n$ customers, who arrive and leave on set days. Let's sort each customer by
their start time so that we do not have a customer arriving at say, time 3,
occupying a room before a customer that arrives at time 2.

Now, we can iterate through the customers while maintaining a minimum priority
queue that stores the departure times of customers we've already processed. For
each customer, we check to see if the minimum element in the priority queue is
less than the arrival time of the new customer.

- If this is true, that means a room previously occupied has opened up, so we
  remove the minimum element from the priority queue and replace it with the new
  customer's departure time. The new customer will be allocated to the same room
  as the customer who departed.
- Otherwise, all the rooms are full, so we need to allocate another room for the
  customer and add it to the priority queue.

We can determine $k$ by finding the maximum size the priority queue reaches as
we iterate through the customers.

### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

Implementation Note: Similarly to what was done in an [earlier module](/silver/sorting-custom?lang=cpp#sorting-in-descending-order), we can use `greater<>()` to create a min-heap instead of a max-heap.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int N;
	cin >> N;

	vector<int> ans(N);
	vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> v(N);

	v.resize(N);
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		cin >> v[i].first.first >> v[i].first.second;
		v[i].second = i;  // store the original index
	}
	sort(v.begin(), v.end());

	int last_room = 0;
	using Room = pair<int, int>;
	priority_queue<Room, vector<Room>, greater<Room>>
	    pq;  // min heap to store departure times.
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		if (pq.empty() || pq.top().first >= v[i].first.first) {
			last_room++;
			pq.push(make_pair(v[i].first.second, last_room));
			ans[v[i].second] = last_room;
		} else {
			// accessing the minimum departure time
			Room minimum = pq.top();
			pq.pop();
			pq.push(make_pair(v[i].first.second, minimum.second));
			ans[v[i].second] = minimum.second;
		}
	}

	cout << last_room << "\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { cout << ans[i] << " "; }
}
```

<JavaSection>

<Warning>
Input classes like `Scanner` and `BufferedReader` are too slow for this problem,
so we have to use [`FastIO`](/general/fast-io?lang=java#even-faster-methods-1) (which reads bytes directly from an input stream) instead.
</Warning>

```java

		Customer[] customers = new Customer[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int arrival = io.nextInt();
			int departure = io.nextInt();
			customers[i] = new Customer(arrival, departure, i);
		}

		// sort customers by arrival time
		Arrays.sort(customers, Comparator.comparingInt(c -> c.arrival));

		PriorityQueue<Room> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
		    // order rooms by departure
		    Comparator.comparingInt(r -> r.departure));

		int k = 0;
		// the room numbers allocated to each customer
		int[] roomAllocations = new int[n];
		// the number of the last new room we've allocated
		int lastRoom = 1;

		// add the first customer to the priority queue
		pq.add(new Room(customers[0].departure, lastRoom));
		roomAllocations[customers[0].index] = lastRoom;

		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			// find the minimum departure time
			Room min = pq.peek();

			if (min.departure < customers[i].arrival) {
				pq.remove();
				pq.add(new Room(customers[i].departure, min.number));

			} else {
				lastRoom++;
				pq.add(new Room(customers[i].departure, lastRoom));
				roomAllocations[customers[i].index] = lastRoom;
			}
			k = Math.max(k, pq.size());
		}

		io.println(k);
		// use StringBuilder to speed up output
		StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
		for (int allocation : roomAllocations) { str.append(allocation).append(" "); }
		io.println(str);
		io.close();
	}

	static class Customer {
		int arrival, departure, index;

		Customer(int arrival, int departure, int index) {
			this.arrival = arrival;

		// number: the number of the room
		int departure, number;

		Room(int departure, int number) {

	}

	// BeginCodeSnip{FastIO}

				c = nextByte();
			} while (c > ' ');
			return res * sgn;
		}
		public double nextDouble() { return Double.parseDouble(next()); }
	}
	// EndCodeSnip

## Problems

<Info title="Sorted Sets">

[Sorted sets](/gold/intro-sorted-sets) support all the operations of priority queues and more; however, their constant factor is worse, and we don't have any examples of USACO Silver problems that require the use of sorted sets.
