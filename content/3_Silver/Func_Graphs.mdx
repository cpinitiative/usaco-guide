It's easy to solve the above problem in $O(N^2)$ time. We'll solve it in $O(N)$.

## Introduction

In a **functional graph**, each node has exactly one out-edge. This is also commonly referred to as a **successor graph**.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="16.3 - Successor Graphs" starred>
		diagrams
	</Resource>
</Resources>

You can think of every connected component of a functional graph as a rooted tree plus an additional edge going out of the root.

## Floyd's Algorithm

**Floyd's Algorithm**, also commonly referred to as the **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**, is capable of detecting cycles in a functional graph in $O(N)$ time and $O(1)$ memory (not counting the graph itself).

### Solution

[Official Tutorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65825)

<!-- https://codeforces.com/contest/1137/submission/87195511 -->

Using **Floyd's Algorithm**, we can find some node on the cycle after $2c\left\lceil \frac{t}{c}\right\rceil$ queries. Then we can find the first node in the cycle after another $t$ queries.

	fflush(stdout);

int N, g[20];

Do you see why this is equivalent to the code mentioned in CPH?

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
a = succ(x);
b = succ(succ(x));
while(a != b) {
	a = succ(a);
	b = succ(succ(b));
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
a = succ(x);
b = succ(succ(x));
while(a != b) {
	a = succ(a);
	b = succ(succ(b));
}
```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>


<br />

$b$ corresponds to friend $1$ and $a$ corresponds to friend $0$.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
a = x;
while(a != b) {
	a = succ(a);
	b = succ(b);
}
first = a;
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
a = x;
while(a != b) {
	a = succ(a);
	b = succ(b);
}
first = a;
```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>


<br />

$a$ corresponds to friends $2\ldots 9$ and $b$ corresponds to friends $0$ and $1$.

<!-- ## Count Cycles

The following sample code counts the number of cycles in such a graph. The "stack" contains nodes that can reach the current node. If the current node points to a node `v` on the stack (`on_stack[v]` is true), then we know that a cycle has been created. However, if the current node points to a node `v` that has been previously visited but is not on the stack, then we know that the current chain of nodes points into a cycle that has already been considered.
