## Introduction

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="12 - Graph traversal" starred />
</Resources>

The purpose of graph traversal algorithms is to visit all nodes within a graph in a certain order and compute some information along the way. Two common algorithms for doing this are **depth first search (DFS)** and **breadth first search (BFS)**.

### Application: Connected Components

<FocusProblem problem="connSample" />

A **connected component** is a maximal set of connected nodes in an undirected
graph. In other words, two nodes are in the same connected component _if and
only if_ they can reach each other via edges in the graph.

In the above focus problem, the goal is to add the minimum possible number of
edges such that the entire graph forms a single connected component.

### Application: Graph Two-Coloring

<FocusProblem problem="bipsample" />

**Graph two-coloring** refers to assigning a boolean value to each node of the
graph, dictated by the edge configuration. The most common example of a
two-colored graph is a **bipartite graph**, in which each edge connects two
nodes of opposite colors.

In the above focus problem, the goal is to assign each node (friend) of the
graph to one of two colors (teams), subject to the constraint that edges
(friendships) connect two nodes of opposite colors. In other words, we need to
check whether the input is a bipartite graph and output a valid coloring if it
is.

> algorithm begins at a starting node, and proceeds to all other nodes that are
> reachable from the starting node using the edges of the graph.
>
> Depth-first search always follows a single path in the graph as long as it
> finds new nodes. After this, it returns to previous nodes and begins to
> explore other parts of the graph. The algorithm keeps track of visited nodes,
> so that it processes each node only once.

When implementing DFS, we often use a recursive function to visit the vertices and an array to store whether we've seen a vertex before.

int n = 6;

void dfs(int current_node) {
	if (visited[current_node]) { return; }
	visited[current_node] = true;

	for (int neighbor : adj[current_node]) { dfs(neighbor); }
}

int main() {
	/*

### Prerequisite - Queues & Deques

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="4.5 - Queues, Deques" />
	<Resource source="PAPS" title="3.2, 6.3 - Queues" />
</Resources>

#### Queues

A queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure that supports three
operations, all in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

[`std::queue`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/)

- `push`: inserts at the back of the queue
- `pop`: deletes from the front of the queue
- `front`: retrieves the element at the front without removing it.

```cpp
queue<int> q;
q.push(1);                  // [1]
q.push(3);                  // [3, 1]
q.push(4);                  // [4, 3, 1]
q.pop();                    // [4, 3]
cout << q.front() << endl;  // 3
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

- `add`: insertion at the back of the queue
- `poll`: deletion from the front of the queue
- `peek`: which retrieves the element at the front without removing it

Java doesn't actually have a `Queue` class; it's only an interface. The most
commonly used implementation is the `LinkedList`, declared as follows:

```java
Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
q.add(1);                      // [1]
q.add(3);                      // [3, 1]
q.add(4);                      // [4, 3, 1]
q.poll();                      // [4, 3]
System.out.println(q.peek());  // 3
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Python has a `queue` built-in module.

- `Queue.put(n)`: Inserts element to the back of the queue.
- `Queue.get()`: Gets and removes the front element. If the queue
  is empty, this will wait forever, creating a TLE error.
- `Queue.queue[n]`: Gets the nth element without removing it. Set
  n to 0 for the first element.

```py
from queue import Queue

q = Queue()  # []
q.put(1)  # [1]
q.put(2)  # [1, 2]
v = q.queue[0]  # v = 1, q = [1, 2]
v = q.get()  # v = 1, q = [2]
v = q.get()  # v = 2, q = []
v = q.get()  # Code waits forever, creating TLE error.
```

<Warning>

Python's `queue.Queue()` uses Locks to maintain a threadsafe synchronization, so it's quite slow.
To avoid TLE, use `collections.deque()` instead for a faster version of a queue.

</Warning>

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

#### Deques

A **deque** (usually pronounced "deck") stands for double ended queue and is a
combination of a stack and a queue, in that it supports $\mathcal{O}(1)$
insertions and deletions from both the front and the back of the deque. Not very
common in Bronze / Silver.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

[`std::deque`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/)

The four methods for adding and removing are `push_back`, `pop_back`,
`push_front`, and `pop_front`.

```cpp
deque<int> d;
d.push_front(3);  // [3]
d.push_front(4);  // [4, 3]
d.push_back(7);   // [4, 3, 7]
d.pop_front();    // [3, 7]
d.push_front(1);  // [1, 3, 7]
d.pop_back();     // [1, 3]
```

You can also access deques in constant time like an array in constant time with
the `[]` operator. For example, to access the $i$th element of a
deque $\texttt{dq}$, do $\texttt{dq}[i]$.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In Java, the deque class is called `ArrayDeque`. The four methods for adding and
removing are `addFirst` , `removeFirst`, `addLast`, and `removeLast`.

```java
ArrayDeque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
deque.addFirst(3);    // [3]
deque.addFirst(4);    // [4, 3]
deque.addLast(7);     // [4, 3, 7]
deque.removeFirst();  // [3, 7]
deque.addFirst(1);    // [1, 3, 7]
deque.removeLast();   // [1, 3]
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

In Python, `collections.deque()` is used for a deque data structure. The four methods for adding and removing are `appendleft`, `popleft`, `append`, and `pop`.
```py
d = collections.deque()
d.appendleft(3)  # [3]
d.appendleft(4)  # [4, 3]
d.append(7)  # [4, 3, 7]
d.popleft()  # [3, 7]
d.appendleft(1)  # [1, 3, 7]
d.pop()  # [1, 3]
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

### Implementation

When implementing BFS, we often use a queue to track the next vertex to visit. Like DFS, we'll also keep an array to store whether we've seen a vertex before.

<LanguageSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
static final int MAX_N = (int)1e6;

public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
	boolean[] visited = new boolean[MAX_N];
	ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
	for (int i = 0; i < MAX_N; i++) adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());

	/*
	 * Define adjacency list and read in problem-specific input
	 *
	 * In this example, we've provided "dummy input" that's
	 * reflected in the GIF above to help illustrate the
	 * order of the recrusive calls.
	 */

	for (int i = 0; i < MAX_N; i++) {
		// iterate over all connected components in the graph
		if (!visited[i]) {
			Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
			q.add(i);

			while (q.size() > 0) {
				int currentNode = q.peek();
				q.poll();

				visited[currentNode] = true;

				for (int neighbor : adj.get(currentNode)) {
					if (!visited[neighbor]) { q.add(neighbor); }
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
int n = 6;
vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
vector<bool> visited(n);

int main() {
	/*
	 * Define adjacency list and read in problem-specific input
	 *
	 * In this example, we've provided "dummy input" that's
	 * reflected in the GIF above to help illustrate the
	 * order of the recrusive calls.
	 */
	adj[0] = {1, 2, 4};
	adj[1] = {3, 4} adj[2].push_back(5);

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		// iterate over all connected components in the graph
		if (!visited[i]) {
			queue<int> q;
			q.push(i);

			while (!q.empty()) {
				int current_node = q.front();
				q.pop();

				visited[current_node] = true;

				for (int neighbor : adj[current_node]) {
					if (!visited[neighbor]) { q.push(neighbor); }
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

</LanguageSection>

## Solution - Building Roads

Note that each edge decreases the number of connected components by either zero
or one. So you must add at least $C-1$ edges, where $C$ is the number of
connected components in the input graph.

To compute $C$, iterate through each node. If it has not been visited,
visit it and all other nodes in its connected component using
DFS or BFS. Then $C$ equals the number of times we perform the visiting
operation.

There are many valid ways to pick $C-1$ new roads to build. One way is to choose
a single representative from each of the $C$ components and link them together
in a line.

### DFS Solution

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int N;
vector<vector<int>> adj;
vector<bool> visited;
vector<int> rep;

void dfs(int node) {
	visited[node] = true;
	for (int u : adj[node])
		if (!visited[u]) dfs(u);
}

int count_components() {
	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
		if (!visited[i]) {
			count++;
			rep.push_back(i);
			dfs(i);
		}
	}
	return count;
}

int main() {
	int M;
	cin >> N >> M;
	adj.resize(N + 1);
	visited.resize(N + 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
		int u, v;
		cin >> u >> v;
		adj[u].push_back(v);
		adj[v].push_back(u);
	}
	int ans = count_components();
	cout << ans - 1 << endl;
	for (int i = 1; i < ans; i++) {
		cout << rep[i - 1] << " " << rep[i] << endl;
	}
}
```

			if next in unvisited:
				unvisited.remove(next)
				dfs(next)

	while unvisited:
		start = unvisited.pop()
		starts.add(start)

	print(len(starts) - 1)
	root = starts.pop()
	for other in starts:

if __name__ == "__main__":
	n, m = map(int, input().split())
	adj = [set() for _ in range(n + 1)]
	for _ in range(m):
		u, v = map(int, input().split())
		adj[u].add(v)
		adj[v].add(u)
	solve(n, adj)
```

However, this code causes a runtime error on five test cases. See the
next subsection for how to fix this.

#### An Issue With Deep Recursion

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

If you run the solution code locally on the line graph generated by the following code:

```py
N = 100000
print(N, N - 1)
for i in range(1, N):
	print(i, i + 1)
```

then you might get a segmentation fault even though your code passes on the
online judge. This occurs because every recursive call contributes to the size
of the [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack), which
is limited to a few megabytes by default. To increase the stack size, refer to
[this module](/general/cpp-command#adjusting-stack-size-mac).
Short answer: If you would normally compile your code with `g++ sol.cpp`,
then compile it with `g++ -Wl,-stack_size,0xF0000000 sol.cpp` instead.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

If you run the solution code locally on the line graph generated by the following code:

```py
N = 100000
print(N, N - 1)
for i in range(1, N):
	print(i, i + 1)
```

then you might get a `StackOverflowError` even though your code passes on the
online judge. This occurs because every recursive call contributes to the size
of the [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack), which is limited
to less than a megabyte by default. To resolve this, you can pass an
option of the form `-Xss...` to run the code with an increased stack size.
For example, `java -Xss512m Main` will run the code with a stack size limit of 512 megabytes.

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

If you run the solution code on the line graph generated by the following code:

```py
N = 100000
print(N, N - 1)
for i in range(1, N):
	print(i, i + 1)
```

then you will observe a *RecursionError* that looks like this:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "input/code.py", line 28, in <module>
	solve(n, adj)
  File "input/code.py", line 14, in solve
	dfs(start, start)
  File "input/code.py", line 9, in dfs
	dfs(start, next)
  File "input/code.py", line 9, in dfs
	dfs(start, next)
  File "input/code.py", line 9, in dfs
	dfs(start, next)
  [Previous line repeated 994 more times]
  File "input/code.py", line 7, in dfs
	if next in unvisited:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
```

This will occur for $N>10^3$ since the recursion limit in Python is set to
[1000](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3323001/what-is-the-maximum-recursion-depth-in-python-and-how-to-increase-it/33008014) by default. We can fix this by increasing the recursion limit:

```py
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)

# BeginCodeSnip{rest of solution}
def solve(n, adj):
	unvisited = set(range(1, n + 1))
	starts = set()

	def dfs(current):
		for next in adj[current]:
			if next in unvisited:
				unvisited.remove(next)
				dfs(next)

	while unvisited:
		start = unvisited.pop()
		starts.add(start)
		dfs(start)

	print(len(starts) - 1)
	root = starts.pop()
	for other in starts:
		print(root, other)


if __name__ == "__main__":
	n, m = map(int, input().split())
	adj = [set() for _ in range(n + 1)]
	for _ in range(m):
		u, v = map(int, input().split())
		adj[u].add(v)
		adj[v].add(u)
	solve(n, adj)
# EndCodeSnip
```

although we still get TLE on two test cases. To resolve this, we can implement a BFS solution, as shown below.

The idea is that for each connected component, we can arbitrarily label a node
and then run DFS or BFS. Every time we visit a new (unvisited) node, we set
its color based on the edge rule. When we visit a previously visited node, check
to see whether its color matches the edge rule.

### DFS Solution

<Optional title="Adjacency List Without an Array of Vectors">

See [here.](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/67883)

</Optional>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

const int MN = 1e5 + 10;

int N, M;
bool bad, vis[MN], group[MN];
std::vector<int> a[MN];

void dfs(int n = 1, bool g = 0) {
	vis[n] = 1;
	group[n] = g;
	for (int u : a[n])
		if (vis[u]) {
			if (group[u] == g) bad = 1;
		} else dfs(u, !g);
}
int main() {
	scanf("%d%d", &N, &M);
	for (int i = 0, u, v; i < M; ++i)
		scanf("%d%d", &u, &v), a[u].push_back(v), a[v].push_back(u);
	for (int i = 1; !bad && i <= N; ++i)
		if (!vis[i]) dfs(i);
	if (bad) printf("IMPOSSIBLE\n");
	else
		for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
			printf("%d%c", group[i] + 1, " \n"[i == N]);
	return 0;
}

<Warning>

Because Java is so slow, an adjacency list using lists/arraylists results in
TLE. Instead, the Java sample code uses the edge representation mentioned in the
optional block above.
