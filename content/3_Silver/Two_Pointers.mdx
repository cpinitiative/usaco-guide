## Two Pointers

The **Two Pointers** algorithm iterates two pointers across an array to track indices satisfying some condition. There are two common ways to use two pointers:
1. Two pointers starting at different ends of the array and moving towards each other.
2. Two pointers moving in the same direction at different speeds. This variation is known as the **Sliding Window** algorithm.

## 2SUM Functionality

The first method is commonly used to find two elements in an array that satisfy a condition (like summing to a target value). We can essentially iterate over all pairs in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time if the array is sorted.

<FocusProblem problem="sample1" />

### Solution - Sum of Two Values

We want to find two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $a_i + a_j = x$.

We can start by sorting the array. Then, we can initialize a left pointer at the beginning of the array ($L=0$) and a right pointer at the end ($R=N-1$).

While $L < R$:
1. If $a[L] + a[R] == x$, we have found the target sum.
2. If $a[L] + a[R] < x$, the sum is too small. To increase the sum, we increment $L$.
3. If $a[L] + a[R] > x$, the sum is too large. To decrease the sum, we decrement $R$.

Since the array is sorted, moving the left pointer to the right will only increase the sum, and moving the right pointer to the left will only decrease the sum.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ (due to sorting)

## Sliding Window

The **Sliding Window** method is a variation of the two pointers technique where two pointers move in the same direction to maintain a specific range or "window" of elements. While standard two pointers often move towards each other, the sliding window technique is used to find a contiguous subarray that satisfies a condition.

<FocusProblem problem="sample2" />

### Solution - Books

We want to find the longest contiguous segment of books that can be read within $t$ minutes.

To accomplish this, we can define $\texttt{left}$ and $\texttt{right}$ to represent the beginning and end of the segment. Both will start at the beginning of the array. These numbers can be thought of as pointers, hence the name "two pointers."

For every value of $\texttt{left}$ in increasing order, let's increase $\texttt{right}$ until the total time for the segment is maximized while being less than or equal to $t$.

$\texttt{ans}$ will store the maximum value of $\texttt{right} - \texttt{left}+1$ (segment size) that we have encountered so far.

After incrementing $\texttt{left}$ by one, the time used decreases, hence the right pointer never has to move leftwards. Thus:

**Since both pointers will move at most $N$ times, the overall time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$.**

As an example, consider the first case in the sample inputs:
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>
We can move the right pointer to index $1$:
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>
The sum of the values in this range is $4$, and there are $2$ values. So, the current maximum segment length is $\texttt{ans}=2$. By incrementing the left pointer by $1$, we can subtract $3$ from the sum of values to get $1$. The array then looks like:
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>
Now, we can move the right pointer to the end. This makes the sum of values $1+2+1=4$ and the length of the segment equal to $3$. So, $\texttt{ans}$ is now $3$.
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>

Since the right pointer has reached the end of the array, we are done at this point. This leaves us with $\texttt{ans}=3$.
