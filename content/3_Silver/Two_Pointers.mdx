## Two Pointers

The two pointers method iterates two pointers across an array, to track the start and end
of an interval. It can also be used to track two values in an array as shown in [CPH's 2SUM](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf#page=87) solution. 

<FocusProblem problem="book" />

## Solution - Books

We want to find the longest contiguous segment of books that can be read within $t$ minutes. 

To accomplish this, we can define $\texttt{left}$ and $\texttt{right}$ as the start and end of the segment respectively and use two pointers to track the interval.

For every $\texttt{left}$ index, we need to increase our $\texttt{right}$ pointer until the total time for that segment is the maximum while being less than $t$.

We will keep track of the max segment size with $\texttt{ans}$, and take the maximum $\texttt{right} - \texttt{left}$ value.

We can then continually increment $\texttt{left}$ by 1.

**The $\texttt{right}$ pointer does not restart after an iteration, it simply keeps moving right; therefore, since both pointers will move at most $N$ times, the overall time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$.**

<Info title="Pro Tip">

You can visualize these pointers as maintaining a sliding window of books for this problem.

### Implementation

<CPPSection>

```cpp
CodeSnip{CPP Short Template}

int main() {
	setIO();
	int n, t, ans = 0;
	cin >> n >> t;
	vi books(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
		cin >> books[i];
	}

	int left = 0, right = 0, cur = 0;
	while (left < n && right < n) {
		// Finding the maximum right for which cur is less than t.
		while (right < n) {
			cur += books[right++];
			// Subtracting the exceeded book from cur.
			if (cur > t) {
				cur -= books[--right]; 
				break;
			}
		}

		ans = max(ans, right - left);
		cur -= books[left++];
	}

	cout << ans;
}
```
