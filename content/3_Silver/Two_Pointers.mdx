## Two Pointers

The two pointers method iterates two pointers across an array, to track the start and end
of an interval. It can also be used to track two values in an array as shown in [CPH's 2SUM](/CPH.pdf#page=87) solution.

<FocusProblem problem="book" />

## Solution - Books

We want to find the longest contiguous segment of books that can be read within $t$ minutes.

To accomplish this, we can define $\texttt{left}$ and $\texttt{right}$ to represent the beginning and end of the segment. Both will start at the beginning of the array. These numbers can be thought of as pointers, hence the name "two pointers."

For every value of $\texttt{left}$ in increasing order, let's increase $\texttt{right}$ until the total time for the segment is maximized while being less than or equal to $t$.

$\texttt{ans}$ will store the maximum value of $\texttt{right} - \texttt{left}+1$ (segment size) that we have encountered so far.

After incrementing $\texttt{left}$ by one, the time used decreases, hence the right pointer never has to move leftwards. Thus:

**Since both pointers will move at most $N$ times, the overall time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$.**

As an example, consider the first case in the sample inputs:
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>
We can move the right pointer to index $1$:
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>
The sum of the values in this range is $4$, and there are $2$ values. So, the current maximum segment length is $\texttt{ans}=2$. By incrementing the left pointer by $1$, we can subtract $3$ from the sum of values to get $1$. The array then looks like:
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>
Now, we can move the right pointer to the end. This makes the sum of values $1+2+1=4$ and the length of the segment equal to $3$. So, $\texttt{ans}$ is now $3$.
<center>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Left Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$\texttt{arr}[i]$</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Right Pointer</td>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th></th>
			<th className="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800"></th>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>

Since the right pointer has reached the end of the array, we are done at this point. This leaves us with $\texttt{ans}=3$.

You can visualize these pointers as maintaining a sliding window of books for this problem.

	for (int l = 0; l < N; sum -= A[l++]) {

      `nums[r] - nums[l] != 0`
      <Quiz.Explanation>

    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      `l < r`
