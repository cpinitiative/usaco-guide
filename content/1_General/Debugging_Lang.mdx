It helps to write readable code ...

## Printing Variables

### Basic Print Statements

The most basic way that you might debug is adding a print statement. This is great and serves the purpose for the most part. For instance, we can write the below to check the value of `x` at a point in our code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int x = 10; // some important variable

void dbg() { cout << "x is " << x << "\n"; }

int main() {
    dbg();
    x = 5000;
    dbg();
}
```

Such print statements are great on a basic level, and we can comment or define them out of our main code when we need to compile and execute a more final version of our code.

However, as great as print statements are, they are annoying to work with and efficiently separate from the actual parts of our code. This is important for example when we want an online judge \(OJ\) to read our output.

### Standard Error Stream

The standard error stream \(`cerr` in C++\) is a quick fix to this. Instead of printing in standard iostream, we actually generate a whole new stream of data called the error stream. Simply replace all instances of `cout` with `cerr`. For example:

```cpp
void dbg() { cerr << "x is " << x << "\n"; }

int main() {
    dbg();
    x = 5000;
    dbg();
}
```

Try running this program and you might be confused about the difference. You will be able to see the output of `cerr` right next to regular `cout` outputs. But this is the beauty of it! And if we use freopen to open up file pipes or submit this to an OJ, the program will not include the error stream.

<Warning>

Printing too much content to `stderr` can still cause TLE when submitting to an OJ.

</Warning>

### Debug Template

<IncompleteSection>

mention line # [macros](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html)

</IncompleteSection>

Although not feasible if you have to write all code from scratch, [this template](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/contest/CppIO.h) is very helpful for simplifying input / output / debug output. Note that `dbg()` only produces debug output when `-DLOCAL` is included as part of the compilation command, so you don't need to comment out those lines before submitting.

[Examples - Debug Output](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/contest/CppIO_test.cpp)

<Warning>

You are not allowed to use pre-written code for USACO contests, so `dbg()` should only be used for other online contests.

</Warning>

## Stress Testing

If your code is getting WA, one option is to run your buggy code against another that you're relatively confident is correct on randomly generated data until you find a difference. See the video for details.

		script from Errichto's video
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Script that was mentioned in video:

```
# A and B are executables you want to compare, gen takes int
# as command line arg. Usage: 'sh stress.sh'
for((i = 1; ; ++i)); do # if they are same then will loop forever
    echo $i
    ./gen $i > int
    ./A < int > out1
    ./B < int > out2
    diff -w out1 out2 || break
    # diff -w <(./A < int) <(./B < int) || break
done
```

We can modify this to work for other situations. For example, if you have the input and output files (ex. `1.in`, `1.out`, `2.in`, `2.out`, ..., `10.out` for old USACO problems) then you can use the following:

```
# A is executable you want to test
for((i = 1; i <= 10; ++i)); do
    echo $i
    ./A < $i.in > out
    diff -w out $i.out || break
done
echo "ALL TESTS PASSED"
```

The following will break on the first input file such that the produced output file is empty.

```
for((i = 1; ; ++i)); do
	echo $i
	./gen $i > int
	./A < int > out
	if ! [[ -s "out" ]] ; then
		echo "no output"
		break
	fi ;
done
```

<JavaSection>

Here is an script to test a Java program with input and output files. You will need to put the `.java`, this script, and the input and output files (`1.in`, `1.out`, etc.) in the same directory:

while $loop; do
	# Does this test case exist?
	if [[ ! -e "$testCase.in" || ! -e "$testCase.out" ]]; then
		# If not, then stop.
		break;
	fi
	
	# If so, then test.
	echo "Testing: $testCase"
	cp $testCase.in $className.in
	java $className.java < $className.in > $className.out

	diffOut=$(diff -w $testCase.out $className.out 2>&1)

	if [[ $diffOut == "" ]]; then
		echo -e "$GREEN** PASSED **$NC\n"
	else
		echo -e "$RED** FAILED **$NC"
		echo -e "$diffOut\n"
		wrong=$((wrong += 1))
	fi
	
	testCase=$((testCase += 1))

# Check if any wrong.
if [[ wrong -gt 0 ]]; then
	if [[ $wrong == 1 ]]; then
		echo -e "$RED*** $wrong/$testCase TEST CASE FAILED ***$NC"
	else

If you want to learn how to write these scripts yourself, you can check [here](https://usaco.guide/general/cpp-command#linux) (but take this advice with a grain of salt since I'm not so proficient myself ...).

<Warning>

This won't work if you're using Windows. Instead, you can use what [tourist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU3HY5GLVnY&t=58m58s) does:

```
:: save this in test.bat

@echo off
gen > in
your_sol out

fc out correct_out

### Warning Options

<Resources>
	<Resource starred source="GCC" url="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html" title="3.8 - Options to Request or Suppress Warnings">documentation for options below</Resource>
</Resources>

Such as the following:

```
-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wconversion -Wfloat-equal -Wduplicated-cond -Wlogical-op
```

You can check the CF blog above for descriptions of these.

#### `-Wextra`

> Some extra warning flags that are not enabled by `-Wall`

Doesn't seem so useful in a contest setting? Except maybe the following:

```
-Wunused-parameter
-Wunused-but-set-parameter
```

#### `-Wshadow`

<Resources>
	<Resource source="LCPP" url="ttps://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-shadowing-name-hiding/" title="6.5 - Variable Shadowing (Name Hiding)" starred> </Resource>
</Resources>

Avoid variable shadowing!

### Other Options

Let's give some examples of what each of these do.

<Warning>
	
These can slow down compilation time and more importantly, runtime. So don't enable these when speed is of the essence (ex. for Facebook Hacker Cup).

</Warning>

<Warning>

`-fsanitize` flags [don't work with mingw](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/3163). If you're using Windows but still want to use these flags, consider using [an online compiler](https://repl.it/) (or installing Linux) instead.

</Warning>

#### `-fsanitize=undefined`

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="GCC"
		title="3.12 - Program Instrumentation Options"
		url="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html"
	>
		documentation for -fsanitize
	</Resource>
</Resources>

The following `prog.cpp` gives a segmentation fault.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> v;
    cout << v[-1];
}
```

`g++ prog.cpp -o prog -fsanitize=undefined && ./prog` produces:

```
/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.2.0_1/include/c++/9.2.0/bits/stl_vector.h:1043:34: runtime error: pointer index expression with base 0x000000000000 overflowed to 0xfffffffffffffffc
zsh: segmentation fault  ./prog
```

Another example with `prog.cpp` as the following:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int v[5];
	cout << v[5];
}
```

`g++ prog.cpp -o prog -fsanitize=undefined && ./prog` produces:

```
prog.cpp:6:13: runtime error: index 5 out of bounds for type 'int [5]'
prog.cpp:6:13: runtime error: load of address 0x7ffee0a77a94 with insufficient space for an object of type 'int'
0x7ffee0a77a94: note: pointer points here
  b0 7a a7 e0 fe 7f 00 00  25 b0 a5 0f 01 00 00 00  b0 7a a7 e0 fe 7f 00 00  c9 8c 20 72 ff 7f 00 00
              ^
```

`-fsanitize=undefined` also catches integer overflow. Let `prog.cpp` be the following:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x = 1<<30;
	cout << x+x;
}
```

`g++ prog.cpp -o prog -fsanitize=undefined && ./prog` produces:

```
prog.cpp:6:15: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 1073741824 * 2 cannot be represented in type 'int'
```

We can also use `-fsanitize=undefined` with `-fsanitize-recover`. Error recovery for `-fsanitize=undefined` is turned on by default, but

>  The `-fno-sanitize-recover=` option can be used to alter this behavior: only the first detected error is reported and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.

So if `prog.cpp` is as follows:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << (1<<32) << endl;
	cout << (1<<32) << endl;
	cout << (1<<32) << endl;
}
```

then

```
g++ -fsanitize=undefined prog.cpp -o prog && ./prog
```

produces:

```

```

while

```
g++ -fsanitize=undefined -fno-sanitize-recover prog.cpp -o prog && ./prog
```

produces:

For more helpful information we should additionally compile with the `-g` flag, which generates a file containing debugging information based on the line numbering of the program. `-fsanitize=address` can then access the file at runtime and give meaningful errors. This is great because it helps diagnose (or "sanitize" if you will) errors such as out of bounds, exceptions, and segmentation faults, even indicating precise line numbers. Feel free to delete the debug file after the run of course.

Using a debugger varies from language to language and even IDE to different IDE. For now I will describe the basic operations of a debugger.

A debugger allows you to pause a code in its execution and see the values as a given point in the debugger.

To do this, set a "breakpoint" at a certain line of code. When the code runs to that breakpoint, it will pause and you will be able to inspect all the different variables at that certain instance.

There are two more useful and common operations. Once you are at the breakpoint, you may want to see what happens after the current line is executed. This would be the "Step Over" button that will allow you to move to the next line. Say you are at a line with the following code: `dfs(0,-1)`, if you click "step over" the debugger will ignore showing you what happens in this function and go to the next line. If you click "step in," however, you will enter the function and be able to step through that function.

In essense, a debugger is a tool to "trace code" for you. It is not much different from just printing the values out at various points in your program.

Pros of using a debugger:

- No need to write print statements so you save time
- You can step through the code in real time

Cons of using a debugger:

- You cannot see the overall "output" of your program at each stage. For example, if I wanted to see every single value of `i` in the program, I could not using a debugger.
- Most advanced competitive programmers do not use debuggers; it is usually not very efficient to use one during a contest.
