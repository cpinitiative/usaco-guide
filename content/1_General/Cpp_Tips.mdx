### Recursive Lambdas

If we add the following from the link above in C++14:

```cpp
namespace std {

template<class Fun>
class y_combinator_result {
  Fun fun_;
public:
  template<class T>
  explicit y_combinator_result(T &&fun): fun_(std::forward<T>(fun)) {}

  template<class ...Args>
  decltype(auto) operator()(Args &&...args) {
    return fun_(std::ref(*this), std::forward<Args>(args)...);
  }
};

template<class Fun>
decltype(auto) y_combinator(Fun &&fun) {
  return y_combinator_result<std::decay_t<Fun>>(std::forward<Fun>(fun));
}

} // namespace std
```

Then we can have code like the following!

```cpp
int main() {
  cout << y_combinator([](auto gcd, int a, int b) -> int {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
  })(20,30) << "\n"; // outputs 10
}
```

Looks like [ecnerwala](https://codeforces.com/contest/1375/submission/86008510) uses these a lot.

## Vectorization

[Pragmas](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Pragmas.html) provide additional information to the compiler. Sometimes you'll see the following lines at the beginning of a program.

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize ("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target ("avx2")
```

According to KACTL:

- `#pragma GCC optimize ("Ofast")` will make GCC auto-vectorize for loops and optimizes floating points better (assumes associativity and turns off [denormals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number)).
- `#pragma GCC target ("avx,avx2")` can double performance of vectorized code, but causes crashes on old machines.

 <!-- - Also consider the older `#pragma GCC target ("sse4")`. -->

According to CodinGame,

> Modern CPUs can execute up to four instructions at the same time if they are independent.

Can also check Wikipedia articles about [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) and [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) (AVX is the more advanced version).

### Examples from CF

The occasional Div 1 E is trivialized by this!

<!-- - [`unroll-loops`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/89815160): TLE 49 -->
<!-- - [`Ofast`, `unroll-loops`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/89815262): 3509ms -->

- [Nagini](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/47823825)
  - [no pragmas](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/89815214): TLE 30
  - [`O3`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/89815479): 3509ms
  - [`Ofast`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/89815327): 3525ms
  - [`Ofast`, `avx`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/72962496): 2339ms
  - [`Ofast`, `avx2`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/72962508): 1544ms
  - [`Ofast`, `sse4`](https://codeforces.com/contest/855/submission/72962469): 2479ms
- [Welcome home, Chtholly](https://codeforces.com/contest/896/submission/47824007)
  - only `Ofast`: TLE
  - `avx`: 2354ms
  - `avx2`: 1684ms
  - `sse4`: 2183ms
- [Awesome Substrings](https://codeforces.com/contest/1270/submission/68018017)
  - `sse4` / `avx`: TLE
  - `avx2`: 6894ms

### Where Can I Use These?

Whether these pragmas are supported depends on the computer architecture (see [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html#x86-Options)).

- `Ofast` with `avx2` works on CF and DMOJ.
- `sse4` and `avx` cause runtime errors on InfoArena and [SzkopuÅ‚](https://szkopul.edu.pl/). However, `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` seems to work on InfoArena (compare [TLE](https://www.infoarena.ro/job_detail/2641920) and [AC](https://www.infoarena.ro/job_detail/2641921)).
- I don't have reason to believe that these work for USACO.

### Why Should I _Not_ Use These?

From [this comment](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66279?#comment-502965):

> To everyone who doesn't know what's going on here: seems that topicstarter doesn't know it either, and it looks like some magic for him.

It's **not** a good idea to include these pragmas at the start of every program. As mentioned above, these pragmas cause RE on some sites. Other times, they are just ignored by the compiler, or even worse, they might make your code slower instead of faster (ex. see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28875325/gcc-optimization-flag-o3-makes-code-slower-than-o2)).

<!-- Anyways, keep in mind that these rarely make a difference in competitive programming. -->
