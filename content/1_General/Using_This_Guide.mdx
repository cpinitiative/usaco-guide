## About This Guide

<Warning title="This guide is NOT a syllabus!!">

Topics on this guide reflect _past_ problems, not _future_ problems. Contest
problems may contain topics that aren't mentioned in this guide, and topics that
appear in one division of this guide may appear in lower divisions in future
contests.

</Warning>

- For Bronze, Silver, and Gold contestants, we aim to be a "**one stop shop**,"
  meaning that this is the only site you have to use to be exposed to most (if
  not all) of the topics required for Bronze to Gold.<Asterisk>Of course, you
  should still use other websites as necessary.</Asterisk>
- For Platinum contestants, we'll try our best to cover the main topics.
- The "Advanced" section contains material that is relevant for USACO Camp and
  beyond.

**Note:** We are currently focusing on the General - Gold sections. Modules that
are part of Platinum and Advanced will remain mostly incomplete for the time
being.

<!--  <Asterisk>There are too many topics for us to effectively cover all of them. If you want to do well in Platinum, you will have to find additional resources on your own in addition to this site</Asterisk> -->

## How to Use This Guide

- Use the **Module Progress** dropdowns (to the right of the module title and at
  the bottom of the page) to track your progress through this guide! Changes
  will be reflected by the navigation bar on the left.
- If you're stuck, ask for help in the
  [USACO Forum](https://forum.usaco.guide/), an unofficial Q&A forum for USACO
  contestants and competitive programmers.
- Read through all starred resources before continuing!
- We highly recommend doing all starred problems. If you need more practice, try
  some of the unstarred ones.
  - Difficulty represents how challenging a problem is expected to be to someone
    after they read through the module, and is **not** comparable across
    modules.
  - It's okay to skip "Very Hard" or "Insane" problems in Bronze - Gold and
    return to them later.
- See [Introducing Modules](/general/modules) for more information.

**Skipping around** is especially recommended for higher level contestants
(Gold/Platinum). Feel free to
<TextTooltip content="You can do this by scrolling to the end of a module">mark
a module</TextTooltip> as "Skipped" and come back to it at a later time!

For lower level contestants, the guide is generally<Asterisk>There are some
exceptions; for example, the last module in "Silver -> Sorting" assumes
knowledge of the first two modules in "Silver -> Ordered Sets & Maps." In any
case, we will list prerequisites to each module as needed.</Asterisk> designed
to be completed in order. However, feel free to skip certain modules and come
back to it later.
