This module is based on both of these resources. I've included the content that is most relevant to USACO.

## Pre-Submit

<IncompleteSection>

todo - find particularly bad example of repetition

</IncompleteSection>

 - Don't repeat yourself!
 - Your code should be readable (to yourself at the very least). Variables should be given meaningful names.
   - See [style tips](/general/debugging-lang#style).
 - Use plenty of [print statements](/general/debugging-lang#printing-variables).

## Wrong Answer

 - Read the full problem statement again.
 - Read your code again.
 - Have you understood the problem correctly?
 - Is your output format correct? 
   - Did you remove debug output before submitting?
 - Add some [assertions](/general/debugging-lang#assertions--warnings), resubmit.
 - Are you sure your algorithm works? 
   - Go through the algorithm for a simple case / write some testcases to run your algorithm on.
 - Do you handle all corner cases (such as $N=1$) / special cases?
 - Any undefined behavior?
   - Includes (but not limited to) uninitialized variables, array out of bounds, shifting int by $\ge 32$ bits, not returning anything from non-`void` functions.
   - Can result in different outputs locally / on the USACO server.
   - Compiling with [additional options](/general/debugging-lang#other-options) can help catch these.
 - Any overflows or NaNs?
 - Confusing $N$ and $M$, $i$ and $j$, etc.?
 - Shadowed or unused variables?
   - Compile with [warning options](/general/debugging-lang#warning-options).
 - Write a test case generator and a (simpler) slow solution and compare the outputs 
   - See [stress testing](/general/debugging-lang#stress-testing).
   - You can compare against a model solution (if available).
 - Rewrite your solution from the start.
   - Don't delete your previous program. Make a new file! It's always possible that you might introduce more bugs.

## Runtime Error

 - Have you tested all corner cases locally?
 - Any undefined behavior? (see above)
 - Are you reading or writing outside the range of any vector?
 - Any assertions that might fail?
 - Any possible division by 0? (mod 0 for example)
 - Any possible infinite recursion?
 - Invalidated pointers or iterators?
 - Are you using too much memory?

## Time Limit Exceeded

 - Do you have any possible infinite loops?
 - What is the complexity of your algorithm?
 - Avoid `vector`, `map`. (use `array`s / `unordered_map`)

## Before Posting on the [Forum](https://forum.usaco.guide/)

 - Try everything above first.
   - If you've found a small counter-test, you should be able to figure out why your code isn't working on your own via print statements.
 - Provide a link to the problem (and the relevant module, if applicable).
 - Include what you've attempted so far.
 - If you have code, post it (formatted as described [here](https://forum.usaco.guide/t/welcome-to-the-usaco-forum/7/2)).
   - Add comments. 
   - If you know which part doesn't work, mention it.
