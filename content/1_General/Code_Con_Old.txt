Following the code conventions mentioned in the following link might make your code more readable.

However, since code for the USACO Guide is contributed from several authors, code style will **not** be uniform. We still strive for code that is readable and understandable! If any code does not compile or is hard to read, please contact us!

### Java

A normal Java template will contain a main method, helpful imports, and some form of I/O. See `Kattio` from the [I/O module](https://usaco.guide/general/input-output#java) for an example.

### Python

A python template is not really necessary; however, it is a good idea to have a main method to keep the structuring of your code clean, and it may be useful to add in easy [file I/O support](/general/input-output#python-1).

```py
import sys # Necessary for sys.stdin and sys.stdout

def main(file):
    sys.stdin = open(file + ".in", "r") # redirects standard input to file
    sys.stdout = open(file + ".out", "w") # redirects standard output to file
    # your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main("") # calls main method
```
