### IDEs

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) are popular IDEs for
developing C++ applications on Windows. Although they are good for developing applications, they can be rather
cumbersome when writing individual code files for competitive programming. For this reason, many prefer to use a text
editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not to be confused with Visual Studio).

### Compilers

There are several ways to get compiler support working on windows. Depending on your preference, you may choose one.

#### MinGW

If you want to keep the ease of use and simplicity of Linux C++, with the ability to use commands like `g++` and easily
include `<bits/stdc++.h>`, you can install the compiler MinGW. This is a version of the `g++` compiler from Linux
available on Windows. If you are using VS Code, setting up MinGW can be more difficult, but there are great guides to
make the process easier.

#### Microsoft Compiler Toolset

Microsoft's Visual C++ Compiler is the official compiler for compiling programs for Windows and can be installed either
via installing the relevant packages with Visual Studio 2019 or the build tools from their website. More information
on its installation can be found
[in their documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160).

In order to get a similar library to `<bits/stdc++.h>` you can use the following template:

```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
#include <__msvc_all_public_headers.hpp>
#endif
#ifdef __linux__
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#endif
using namespace std;
```

This checks if the compiler is compiling for windows (your local machine) or if it is compiling for the remote judge and
subsequently includes the correct libraries for the system.

*Note: this comes with the same consequences as using `<bits/stdc++.h>` for the same reasons*.

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux, commonly referred to as WSL, acts as a compatibility layer, allowing you to install and run
linux executables. This means that you can install `g++`, use `g++`, and consequently include `<bits/stdc++.h>`. To
install the necessary tools on WSL.

To install the necessary tools after setting up WSL, you can run the following commands.

On Debian based distributions like Ubuntu:
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

On Arch based distributions like Arch Linux:
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy base-devel
```

More information can be found on the [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
