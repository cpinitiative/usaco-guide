## Printing Variables

### Basic Print Statements

The most basic way that you might debug is adding a print statement. This is
great and serves the purpose for the most part. For instance, we can write the
below to check the value of `x` at a point in our code.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int x = 10;  // pretend this variable is important

void dbg() { cout << "x = " << x << endl; }

int main() {
	dbg();  // x = 10
	x = 5000;
	dbg();  // x = 5000
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
public class Main {
	static int x = 10;  // pretend this variable is important

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		dbg();  // x = 10
		x = 5000;
		dbg();  // x = 5000
	}

	static void dbg() {
		System.out.print("x = ");
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

```py
x = 10  # pretend this variable is important


def dbg():
	print("x =", x)


dbg()  # x = 10
x = 5000
dbg()  # x = 5000
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

Such print statements are great on a basic level, and we can comment or define
them out of our main code when we need to compile and execute a more final
version of our code.

### Standard Error Stream

However, as great as print statements are, they are annoying to work with and
efficiently separate from the actual parts of our code. This is important for
example when we want an online judge (OJ) to read our output.

The standard error stream is a quick fix to this. Instead of
printing in the standard output stream, we can print in a whole new stream
called the standard error stream instead.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int x = 10;

void dbg() { cerr << "x = " << x << endl; }

int main() {
	dbg();
	x = 5000;
	dbg();
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
public class Main {
	static int x = 10;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		dbg();
		x = 5000;
		dbg();
	}

	static void dbg() {
		System.err.print("x = ");
		System.err.println(x);
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

```py
import sys

x = 10


def dbg():
	print("x =", x, file=sys.stderr)


dbg()  # outputs 10
x = 5000
dbg()  # now outputs 5000
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

Try running this program and you might be confused about the difference. The
content in the error stream appears right alongside that in the standard output
stream. But this is the beauty of it! And the best thing about it is, if we
submit this program to an OJ, it won't notice the output in the error stream
at all!

<Warning>

Printing too much content to the error stream can cause TLE when
submitting to an OJ.

</Warning>

### Debugging Macro

<Resources>
	<Resource source="GCC" url="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html" title="Standard Predefined Macros">
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Here's a handy macro that prints the line number (`__LINE__`) and the name of
the variable (`#v`) in addition to the value of the variable (`v`).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define dbg(v)                                                                 \
	cout << "Line(" << __LINE__ << ") -> " << #v << " = " << (v) << endl;

int x = 10;  // pretend this variable is important

int main() {
	dbg(x);  // Line(10) -> x = 10
	x = 5000;
	dbg(x);  // Line(12) -> x = 5000
}
```

### Debugging STL Data Structures

As C++ does not contain built-in print functions for many of its built-in
data structures, it would be good to have some prewritten code to print them.
[This](https://gist.github.com/SansPapyrus683/61b65d4d7ec223b48ebf5c3bb382ba8d)
template is rather easy to use. It includes support for basically all of the
needed data structures in competitive programming. Here's how you would use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#include "debugging.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> arr{1, 2, 3, 4};
	cout << arr << endl;  // just feed it into cout like any other variable
}
```

<Warning>

You are not allowed to use pre-written code for USACO contests, so this template
should only be used for other online contests.

</Warning>

## Assertions & Warnings

<Resources>

		title="Asserts"
		source="LCPP"
		url="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/7-12a-assert-and-static_assert/"
		starred
	>
		Includes `static_assert` and `#define NDEBUG`.

		url="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Diagnostics.html"
		starred
	>
		Talks about `#warning` and `#error`.
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Use `assert(cond)` to check that a condition `cond` holds. If it doesn't, then the program is terminated. For example, the following code snippet

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	assert(false);
	cout << "OK" << endl;
}
```

produces:

```
prog: main.cpp:6: int main(): Assertion `false' failed.
/tmp/program/run.sh: line 1:   408 Aborted                 ./prog
Command exited with non-zero status 134
```

If you want to disable all asserts (say, before submitting) you can add
`#define NDEBUG` to the start of your program.

```cpp
#define NDEBUG
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	assert(false);
	cout << "OK" << endl;  // OK
}
```

## Stress Testing

If your code is getting WA, one option is to run your buggy solution against
another solution that you're relatively confident is correct on randomly
generated test cases until you find a difference. Usually, small test cases
will suffice. See the video for details.

	</Resource>
</Resources>

### Option 1: A Single Program

Write a single program including the two solutions and an input generator. If
using C++, you should wrap each solution in a separate namespace to avoid
compilation errors, like so:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

namespace Solution1 {

int solve(int x) { return x < 10; }

}  // namespace Solution1

namespace Solution2 {

int solve(int x) { return x < 11; }

}  // namespace Solution2

int main() {
	mt19937 rng(0);
	while (true) {
		int x = rng() % 100;
		int out1 = Solution1::solve(x);
		int out2 = Solution2::solve(x);
		if (out1 != out2) {
			cout << x << " " << out1 << " " << out2 << endl;
			exit(0);
		}
	}
}
```

Of course, you can only use this option if both solutions are written in the
same language.

### Option 2: Three Programs

Another option is to write three different programs, one for the correct program,
one for the incorrect program, and one for generating inputs. Then
you can use the script below to find an input on which the correct and
incorrect programs differ. If you want to learn how to write these scripts
yourself, see [this module](/general/cpp-command#linux).

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

<Spoiler title="Scripts">

Here is the script that was mentioned in the video:

```
# A and B are executables you want to compare, gen takes int
# as command line arg. Usage: 'sh stress.sh'
for ((i = 1; ; ++i)); do  # if they are same then will loop forever
    echo $i
    ./gen $i > int
    ./A < int > out1
    ./B < int > out2
    diff -w out1 out2 || break
    # diff -w <(./A < int) <(./B < int) || break
done
```

We can modify this to work for other situations. For example, if you have
input and output files (e.g., `1.in`, `1.out`, `2.in`, `2.out`, ..., `10.out` for
old USACO problems) then you can use the following:

```
# A is the executable you want to test
for ((i = 1; i <= 10; ++i)); do
    echo $i
    ./A < $i.in > out
    diff -w out $i.out || break
done
echo "ALL TESTS PASSED"
```

The following will break on the first input file such that the produced output
file is empty.

```
for((i = 1; ; ++i)); do
	echo $i
	./gen $i > int
	./A < int > out
	if ! [[ -s "out" ]] ; then
		echo "no output"
		break
	fi ;
done
```

<Warning>

This won't work if you're using Windows. Instead, you can use what
[tourist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU3HY5GLVnY&t=58m58s) does:

```
:: save this in test.bat

@echo off
gen > in
your_sol out
correct_sol correct_out
fc out correct_out
if errorlevel 1 exit
test
```
</Warning>

Here is an script to test a Java program with input and output files. You will
need to put the `.java`, this script, and the input and output files (`1.in`,
`1.out`, etc.) in the same directory:

<Spoiler title="Java testing script">

```
#!/bin/bash
RED="\033[0;31m"
GREEN="\033[0;32m"
NC="\033[0m"

wrong=0

fileName=$(ls | grep java)

IFS="."
read -ra fileArr <<< $fileName

className=${fileArr[0]}

loop=true
testCase=1

while $loop; do
	# Does this test case exist?
	if [[ ! -e "$testCase.in" || ! -e "$testCase.out" ]]; then
		# If not, then stop.
		break;
	fi

	# If so, then test.
	echo "Testing: $testCase"
	cp $testCase.in $className.in
	java $className.java < $className.in > $className.out

	diffOut=$(diff -w $testCase.out $className.out 2>&1)

	if [[ $diffOut == "" ]]; then
		echo -e "$GREEN** PASSED **$NC\n"
	else
		echo -e "$RED** FAILED **$NC"
		echo -e "$diffOut\n"
		wrong=$((wrong += 1))
	fi

	testCase=$((testCase += 1))
done

# Check if any wrong.
if [[ wrong -gt 0 ]]; then
	if [[ $wrong == 1 ]]; then
		echo -e "$RED*** $wrong/$testCase TEST CASE FAILED ***$NC"
	else
		echo -e "$RED*** $wrong/$((testCase - 1)) TEST CASES FAILED ***$NC"
	fi
else
	echo -e "$GREEN*** ALL TEST CASES PASSED ***$NC"
fi
```

In essence, a debugger is a tool to "trace code" for you. Using a debugger
varies from language to language and even from IDE to different
IDE, so we will only go over the basics of a debugger.

Pros of using a debugger:

- No need to write print statements so you save time.
- You can step through the code in real time.
- C++: Print the line where a runtime error was triggered.

Cons of using a debugger:

- It is not much different from just printing the values out at various points
  in your program.
- Most competitive programmers do not use debuggers.
- You cannot see the overall "output" of your program at each stage. For
  example, if you wanted to see every single value of `i` in the program,
  you could not using a debugger.

### Breakpoints

A debugger allows you to pause a code in its execution and see the values as a
given point in the debugger. To do this, set a "breakpoint" at a certain line of code. When the code runs to
that breakpoint, it will pause and you will be able to inspect all the different
variables at that certain instance.

There are two more useful and common operations. Once you are at the breakpoint,
you may want to see what happens after the current line is executed. This would
be the "Step Over" button that will allow you to move to the next line. Say you
are at a line with the following code: `dfs(0, -1)`, if you click "step over" the
debugger will ignore showing you what happens in this function and go to the
next line. If you click "step in," however, you will enter the function and be
able to step through that function.
