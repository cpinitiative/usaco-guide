## Regional Programming Contests Within the USA

<!-- This list is surely quite incomplete -- if you run or know about other regional programming contests in the USA please email bcdean@clemson.edu to let us know to include a link to your contest!

## Other Camps and Courses in the USA

There are of course many different computing camps and programs available for high-school students in different regions of the USA, but not so many tend to focus on algorithmic problem-solving. Some notable examples of programs that do focus on algorithmic problem solving include a new 2-week summer programming training camp for high-school students at the University of Central Florida, aimed at students who want to excel in programming contests like the USACO ([details](http://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/programming-competition-overview/)). In the Orange County Area (also in the Bay Area and online), [Star League](https://starleague.us/index.php/courses/a-star-computer-sciences), in the Bay Area, [Alpha Star Academy](https://alphastar.academy/) and [Ascende Learning](https://ascendelearning.com/), and in Northern Virginia, [Absolute Academy](https://www.absoluteacademy.net/) offer courses based on the USACO curriculum. Prof. Rajiv Gandhi organizes a [Program on Algorithmic Thinking](http://algorithmicthinking.org/) at Princeton University that provides summer program for high-school students interested in theoretical computer science. The [KTBYTE](https://www.ktbyte.com/) program offers relevant classes in Massachusetts and also online. An organization called "Stem Ivy" offers online [courses](http://usacocoach.com) geared towards USACO training.

## USA Participation in Other International Olympiads

The USACO is one of several national organizations in the USA that select teams
of students to participate in their respective International Science Olympiads.
The most prominent are the
[USA Mathematics Olympiad (USAMO)](http://amc.maa.org/usamo/usamo.shtml), the
[US Physics Team (USAPhO)](http://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/program.cfm), the
[US National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO)](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/olympiad.html),
and the [USA Biolympiad (USABO)](http://www.usabo-trc.org).
