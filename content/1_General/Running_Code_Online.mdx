## Running Code Online

In all of C++, Python, Java. All of these options are free.

<!-- - [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
  - online compiler with embedded GDB debugger
  - supports files and file I/O
  - can be buggy sometimes -->

- [ide.usaco.guide](https://ide.usaco.guide/)
  - Real-time collaboration (share the URL including the hash)
  - The number of submissions is limited, so please don't excessively spam the
    "Run" button...
  - Can be unstable at times; if it starts acting weird, then make a new file. Report issues [on Github](https://github.com/cpinitiative/ide).
  - This is the newer version of https://ide.thecodingwizard.me/
- [ide.judge0.com](https://ide.judge0.com/)
  - Basically the above except without real-time collaboration, more stable.
- [Ideone](http://ideone.com/)
  - Has the bare minimum you need.
  - Sometimes erases your code when you first create it (so get in the habit of
    copying your code first).
- [CSAcademy Workspace](https://csacademy.com/workspace/)
  - Pretty nice (unless you get "Estimated Queue Time: ...")
  - "Saved locally" will **not** save your code if you close the tab, press
    Command-S to save.
- [repl.it](https://repl.it/)
  - Real-time collaboration.
  - Need to pay to create private repls.
- [goormIDE](https://ide.goorm.io/)
  - Real-time collaboration

You can also share code with [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or
[hastebin](https://hastebin.com/).

<Warning>

Your code should not be publicly viewable during a contest. For example, if
you're using Ideone, set your code to be secret or private.

<!-- If you use Ideone during an online contest (such as a Codeforces round), you **must** ensure that your code is set to be private. **You will be punished for cheating if another person finds and copies your code during the contest, even if you never intentionally provide the code to anyone.** -->

<!-- Even if you are not doing an online contest, you might want to set your code to be private for other reasons. -->

</Warning>
