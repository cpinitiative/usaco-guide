## Running Code Online

In all of C++, Python, Java.

<!-- - [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
  - online compiler with embedded GDB debugger
  - supports files and file I/O
  - can be buggy sometimes -->

- [ide.thecodingwizard.me](https://ide.thecodingwizard.me/)
  - real-time collaboration (share the URL including the hash)
  - The number of submissions is limited, so please don't excessively spam the "Run" button...
  - Can be unstable at times; if it starts acting weird, then make a new file.
- [ide.judge0.com](https://ide.judge0.com/)
  - Basically the above except without real-time collaboration, more stable.
  - If you don't need real-time collaboration use this over the above.
- [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/workspace/)
  - pretty nice (unless you get "Estimated Queue Time: ...")
  - "saved locally" will **not** save your code if you close the tab, press Command-S to save.
- [Ideone](http://ideone.com/)
  - okay ... has the bare minimum you need
  - sometimes erases your code when you first create it (so get in the habit of copying your code first)
- [repl.it](https://repl.it/)
  - real-time collaboration
  - need to pay to create private repls (so don't use free version for a contest ...)

You can also share code with [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/).

<Warning>

If you use Ideone during an online contest (such as a Codeforces round), you **must** ensure that your code is set to be private. **You will be punished for cheating if another person finds and copies your code during the contest, even if you never intentionally provide the code to anyone.**

Even if you are not doing an online contest, you might want to set your code to be private for other reasons.

</Warning>

## Running Code Locally
