in most cases data types must be aligned to bytes. However, only one bit of
information can be stored in them.

There are several main **data types** that are used in contests: integers,
floating point numbers, booleans, characters, and strings. Assuming that you are
familiar with the language you are using, this should be mostly review.

The normal **32-bit integer** data type (`int` in C++ and Java) supports values
between $−2\,147\,483\,648$ and $2\,147\,483\,647$, which is roughly equal to
$\pm 2 \cdot 10^9$.

Some problems require you to use **64-bit integers** (`long long` in C++ and
`long` in Java) instead of 32-bit integers (`int`). 64-bit integers are less
likely to have overflow issues, since they can store any number between
$-9\,223\,372\,036\,854\,775\,808$ and $9\,223\,372\,036\,854\,775\,807$ which
is roughly equal to $\pm 9 \times 10^{18}$. In Python,
[`int`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)s
have unlimited size.

Sometimes (but not always) a USACO problem statement (ex.
[Haircut](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1041)) will
contain a warning such as the following:

> Note that the large size of integers involved in this problem may require the
> use of 64-bit integer data types (e.g., a "long long" in C/C++).

Contest problems are usually set such that the 64-bit integer is sufficient, so
it might be a good idea to use 64-bit integers in place of 32-bit integers
everywhere. Of course, you shouldn't do this when time and/or memory limits are
tight, which may be the case in higher divisions of USACO. Also note that in
Java, you will need to cast `long` back to `int` when accessing array indices.

Additionally, there exist 16-bit integers (`short` in C++ and Java). However,
these are generally not useful as the extra memory saved by using them is
usually negligible. Unsigned integers (`unsigned int, unsigned long long, etc.`)
also exist, but it's usually easier to use signed integers for most tasks.
However, the 2-fold increase in size is sometimes the difference between
overflowing and not overflowing.

**Floating point numbers** are used to store decimal values. It is important to
know that floating point numbers are not exact, because the binary architecture
of computers can only store decimals to a certain precision. Hence, we should
always expect that floating point numbers are slightly off, so it's generally a
bad idea to compare two floating-point numbers for exact equality (`==`).

Contest problems will usually accommodate the inaccuracy of floating point
numbers by checking if the **absolute** or **relative** difference between your
output and the answer is less than some small constant like $\epsilon=10^{-9}$.

- If your output is $x$ and the answer is $y$, the absolute difference is
  $|x-y|$.
- If your output is $x$ and the answer is $y$, the relative difference is
  $\frac{|x-y|}{|y|}$.

This is not the case for USACO, where problems generally have a unique correct
output. So when floating point is necessary, the output format will be something
along the lines of "Print $10^6$ times the maximum probability of receiving
exactly one accepted invitation, rounded down to the nearest integer." (ex.
[Cow Dating](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=924)).

**Boolean** variables have two possible states: `true` and `false`. We'll
usually use booleans to mark whether a certain process is done, and arrays of
booleans to mark which components of an algorithm have finished. Booleans
require 1 byte (8 bits) of storage, not 1 bit, wasting the other 7 bits of
storage. To use less memory, one can use bitsets (`std::bitset` in C++ / `BitSet` in
Java). Unfortunately, bitsets are not available in Python.

**Character** variables represent a single character. They are returned when you
access the character at a certain index within a string. Characters are
represented using the ASCII standard, which assigns each character to a
corresponding integer. This allows us to do arithmetic with them; for example,
both `cout << ('f' - 'a');` in C++ and `System.out.print('f' - 'a');` in Java
will print `5`. In Java, characters are 16 bits, while in C/C++, characters are
8 bits.

**Strings** are stored as an array of characters. On the back end, there is an
`ArrayList` (you can think of it as a more flexible array which can change its
size if more space is needed), that automatically updates when two strings are
added. There are a few methods such as `substring()` and `charAt()` in Java that
are helpful to know. A loop can be used to access each character of an unknown
string.
