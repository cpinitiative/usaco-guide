## Ways to Contribute

Some examples:

### Lesson

- Convert lists of resources to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Add missing descriptions for sections, modules, or resources.
  - All resources should have descriptions.
- Improve explanations for sample problems.
  - If starred resource or editorial already has a good explanation, no need to repeat it.
- Improve implementations.
  - Include code handling input & output.
  - Should be consistent across languages.
- Adding modules!

### Problems

- Convert lists of problems to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Fix problem difficulties and tags.
- Add problems that are good examples of the module topic (and remove those that are not).
- Adding official editorial links.
  - Those for USACO are automatically generated.
- Adding editorials.
  - If no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved.
  - Or solution code in a different language, etc.

<!-- - Don't link CF if it's already included in "Contest Materials." -->

## Writing Content

All modules are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown + JSX), with limited Latex support from [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and some custom components. You can check how an `.mdx` file renders by pasting it in the [live editor](/liveupdate).

See the [Content Documentation](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/docs/Content%20Documentation.md) for more info.

### Useful Links

- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Markdown Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
  - nice markdown editor
  - supports Katex
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - `.md` syntax highlighting is fine, is also ok for `.mdx`
  - You can open a `.mdx` file and set syntax highlighting to be the same as `.md` with `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as ... -> Markdown -> Markdown`.

### Adding a Solution

First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) the GitHub repository.

If it doesn't already exist, create a new `mdx` file in `solutions` including frontmatter, ex. the following in [`USACO jan17-cow-dance-show.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/solutions/USACO%20jan17-cow-dance-show.mdx):

```

[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_cowdance_silver_jan17.html)

(add solution here ...)
```

Keep file and ID names consistent; namely, USACO IDs should correspond to the URL on [usaco.org](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690). Then add the solution ID (`usaco-690`) as the last argument of the `Problem` constructor in the corresponding module (in this case, [`Binary_Search_Ans.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/3_Silver/Binary_Search_Ans.mdx)).

```
new Problem(
	'Silver',
	'Cow Dance Show',
	'690',
	'Easy',
	false,
	[],
	'usaco-690'
),
```

Make sure to check that both the module and the solution render properly using the live editor before submitting a pull request.
