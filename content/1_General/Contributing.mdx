Note that the USACO Guide has a public [Github Repository](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide). Feel free to contribute by submitting issues and Pull Requests!

**Please help fix some of the [issues](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues) on our Github Repository!**

## Ways to Contribute

Some examples:

### Lesson

- Convert lists of resources to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Add missing descriptions for sections, modules, or resources.
  - All resources should have descriptions.
- Improve explanations for sample problems.
  - If starred resource or editorial already has a good explanation, no need to repeat it.
- Improve implementations.
  - Include code handling input & output.
  - Should be consistent across languages.
- Adding modules!

### Problems

- Convert lists of problems to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Fix problem difficulties and tags.
- Add problems that are good examples of the module topic (and remove those that are not).
- Adding official editorial links.
  - Those for USACO are automatically generated.
- Adding editorials.
  - If no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved.
  - Or solution code in a different language, etc.

<!-- - Don't link CF if it's already included in "Contest Materials." -->

## Writing Content

All modules are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown + JSX), with limited $\LaTeX$ support from [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and some custom components. You can check how an `.mdx` file renders by pasting it in the [live editor](/liveupdate).

See the [Content Documentation](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/docs/Content%20Documentation.md) for more info.

### Useful Links

- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Markdown Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
  - nice markdown editor
  - supports Katex
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - `.md` syntax highlighting is fine, is also ok for `.mdx`
  - You can open a `.mdx` file and set syntax highlighting to be the same as `.md` with `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as ... -> Markdown -> Markdown`.

### Adding a Solution

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) the GitHub repository. 

2. If it doesn't already exist, create a new `mdx` file in `solutions` including frontmatter, ex. the following in [`USACO jan17-cow-dance-show.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/solutions/USACO%20jan17-cow-dance-show.mdx):

  ```

  [Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_cowdance_silver_jan17.html)

  <LanguageSection>

  <CPPSection>

  **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$

  ^ Format time complexity like this.

  (add C++ code + explanation here ...)

  Use `\texttt{}` around variable names with length greater than one, like so. Place long equations on separate lines with display math.

  $$
  \texttt{arr}[i]=2\cdot (a+b+c+d+e)+\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\texttt{arr}[j]
  $$

  </CPPSection>

  <PySection>

  (if you have Python code)

  </PySection>

  <JavaSection>
  
  (if you have Java code)

  </JavaSection>

  </LanguageSection>
  ```

  It is **not** necessary to add an alternative implementation in the same language as the official analysis (unless the alternative implementation takes a different approach or is written better / differently from the official implementation).

  Keep file names and solution IDs consistent; namely, USACO IDs should correspond to the URL on [usaco.org](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690). 

3. Add the solution ID (ex. `usaco-690`) as the last argument of the `Problem` constructor in the corresponding module (in this case, [`Binary_Search_Ans.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/3_Silver/Binary_Search_Ans.mdx)). Also add tags (if you want).

  ```
  new Problem(
    'Silver',
    'Cow Dance Show',
    '690',
    'Easy',
    false,
    ['tag1', 'tag2'],
    'usaco-690'
  ),
  ```

4. Check that both the module and the solution render properly using the [live editor](/liveupdate/) before submitting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
