prerequisites:
  - modules

All modules are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown + JSX) with the
[XDM](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) compiler. $\LaTeX$ is supported through
[KaTeX](https://katex.org/), and the Guide uses a number of custom MDX
components. If you are confused about something, or if there's a certain feature
that you want to add, reach out to Nathan Wang.

## Quick Start

The USACO Guide has a public
[Github Repository](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide).

- If you're looking to add/modify modules, refer to the `content/` folder.
- If you're looking to add/modify problem solutions, refer to the `solutions/`
  folder.
- (Almost) all the other files and folders are related to the front-end code.

If you have any questions about how to contribute, feel free to just open an
[issue](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues) or a
[pull request](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/pulls) and a team
member will be able to assist you. If you want, you can also
[join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/VCxUzdYhzN).

### Using the Editor (recommended)

The easiest way to edit content is to use our live [editor](/editor).

### Running Site Locally

You can also run a local version of the site in order to view your changes. This
is useful if you need to use Tailwind CSS classes, which don't work with
`/editor`.

1. Set up your development environment.
   - Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
     - [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system)
   - Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
     - `npm install -g yarn`? might work
2. Clone repo
   - Via command line:
     `git clone https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide.git`
   - Or use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Install Dependencies
   - `yarn`
4. Run development server
   - `yarn develop`

See the
[front end documentation](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/docs/Front%20End%20Documentation.md)
for more information.

## Ways to Contribute

Some examples:

### Lesson

- Convert lists of resources to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Add missing descriptions for sections, modules, or resources.
  - All resources should have descriptions.
- Improve explanations for sample problems.
  - If starred resource or editorial already has a good explanation, no need to
    repeat it.
- Improve implementations.
  - Make sure code compiles, remove excessive macros, add codesnips around
    templates.
  - Should be consistent across languages.
- Adding modules!
- If you add a substantial amount of text content to a module, add your name to
  the list of authors in the frontmatter.
- If you add code implementations or improve existing implementations in a more
  significant way than simply refactoring code, or if you add a short
  explanation, add your name to the list of contributors.

### Problems

- Convert lists of problems to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Fix problem difficulties and tags.
- Add problems that are good examples of the module topic (and remove those that
  are not).
- Adding official editorial links.
- Adding editorials.
  - If no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved.
  - Or solution code in a different language, etc.

## Markdown Resources

- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Markdown Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

Markdown Editors:

- Using our [online editor](/editor) is probably best.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - `.md` syntax highlighting is fine, is also ok for `.mdx`
  - You can open a `.mdx` file and set syntax highlighting to be the same as
    `.md` with
    `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as ... -> Markdown -> Markdown`.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
  - Automatically compiles $\LaTeX$ (doesn't require an installation)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  - Automatically compiles $\LaTeX$ (doesn't require an installation)

<!-- - Don't link CF if it's already included in "Contest Materials." -->
