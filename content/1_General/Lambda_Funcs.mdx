## Why Use Lambdas?
Lambdas allow us to write simple and anonymous functions inline.
This allows us to write smaller functions while keeping code local and
organized. In addition, lambdas can capture their surrounding variables, which
is often convenient when writing helper functions.

The C++ standard library has good support for lambdas, with functions
like `std::sort` and `std::lower_bound` allowing you to pass custom functions
to act as a comparator of objects. This is often more convenient than the
alternative of writing a dedicated function to act as a comparator.

## General Form
Lambdas have the following form:

```
[capture_list](parameters) -> trailing_return_type {
	// function body
}
```

The parameters, return type, and function body are all pretty straightforward.
In competitive programming contexts, we typically use the following capture types:

`[]`: Does not capture anything in the local scope.

`[&]`: Captures everything in the local scope by reference.

`[=]`: Captures everything in the local scope by copy.

**The lambda's local scope is the scope where it is defined, not the scope where it is
used.**

You can also specify what variables to capture, but this typically is not necessary.

For an example of a lambda, say we want to write a function returns the square
of a given number. We can write the following lambda expression:

```cpp
auto square = [](int x) -> long long { return (long long)x * x; };
```

Then, you can call the lambda like a normal function.
```cpp
cout << square(10) << '\n';  // prints out 100
```

As mentioned in the [custom comparator module](/silver/sorting-custom?lang=cpp)
module, lambdas can also be used as comparators.

## Recursive Lambdas

Let's say we want to write a recursive GCD function. With a lambda, the most
straightforward way to write it would be like this:

```cpp
auto gcd = [](int a, int b) -> int { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); };
```

Unfortunately, this does not work, because a lambda cannot directly reference
itself in its definition. However, there are workarounds to this issue.

### With `y_combinator`

</Resources>

If we add the following from the link above in C++14:

```cpp
namespace std {

template <class Fun> class y_combinator_result {
	Fun fun_;

  public:
	template <class T>
	explicit y_combinator_result(T &&fun) : fun_(std::forward<T>(fun)) {}

	template <class... Args> decltype(auto) operator()(Args &&...args) {
		return fun_(std::ref(*this), std::forward<Args>(args)...);
	}
};

template <class Fun> decltype(auto) y_combinator(Fun &&fun) {
	return y_combinator_result<std::decay_t<Fun>>(std::forward<Fun>(fun));
}

}  // namespace std
```

Then we can have code like the following:

```cpp
int main() {
	cout << y_combinator([](auto gcd, int a, int b) -> int {
		return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
	})(20, 30)
	     << "\n";  // outputs 10
}
```

### With [`std::function`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function)

Instead of `auto`, use `function<return_type(param)>`.

```cpp
int main() {
	function<int(int, int)> gcd = [&](int a, int b) {
		return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
	};
	cout << gcd(20, 30) << '\n';  // outputs 10
}
```

### With Generic Lambdas
To remedy the issue of the lambda being unable to access itself, we pass it
into itself.

```cpp
int main() {
	auto gcd = [&](int a, int b, auto &&gcd) -> int {
		return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b, gcd);
	};
	cout << gcd(20, 30, gcd) << '\n';  // outputs 10
}
```
