## Installing GCC

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=instructions) (and most contests)
use [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection)'s `g++` to
compile and run your code. You'll need `g++` specifically to use the
`#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file; see
[Running Code Locally](/general/running-code-locally#including-bitsstdch) for
details.

### On Linux

GCC is usually preinstalled on most Linux distros. You can check if it is
installed with

```
whereis g++
```

If it is not preinstalled, you can probably install it using your distro's
package manager.

### On Windows

There are multiple ways to install C++ command line tools on windows, depending
on your needs. To find more information, go to
[Running Code Locally with Windows](/general/running-code-locally#windows).

### On Mac

1.  Install XCode command line tools.

    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    If you previously installed these you may need to update them:

    ```bash
    softwareupdate --list # list updates
    softwareupdate -i -a # installs all updates
    ```

    After this step, `clang` should be installed (try running `clang --version`
    in Terminal).

2.  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

3.  Install `gcc` with Homebrew.

    ```
    brew install gcc
    ```

    According to
    [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30998890/installing-opencv-with-brew-never-finishes)
    if `brew` doesn't seem to finish for a long time then

    ```
    brew install gcc --force-bottle
    ```

    probably suffices.

4.  You should be able to compile with `g++-#`, where # is the version number
    (e.g., 10). Running the following command

    ```
    g++-10 --version
    ```

    should display something like this:

    ```
    g++-10 (Homebrew GCC 10.2.0_2) 10.2.0
    Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    ```

5.  If you want to be able to compile with just `g++`, write a shell alias! Put
    the following lines into your shell's rc file (`~/.bashrc` if you use
    `bash`, and `~/.zshrc` if you use `zsh`).

    ```bash
    alias g++=g++-10
    ```

    Once you do so, `g++ --version` should now output the same thing as
    `g++-10 --version`.

    Note: avoid overriding the system `g++` with symlinking or hard-linking as
    that will almost surely cause problems. Don't worry if you don't know what
    those terms mean.

## C++ with the Command Line

### Basics of Compiling & Running

Consider a simple program such as the following, which we'll save in `name.cpp`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x; cin >> x;
	cout << "FOUND " << x << "\n";
}
```

It's not hard to
[compile & run a C++ program](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-compile-and-run-the-Cplusplus-program).
First, open up Powershell on Windows, Terminal on Mac, or your distro's terminal
in Linux. We can compile `name.cpp` into an executable named `name` with the
following command:

```
g++ name.cpp -o name
```

Then we can execute the program:

```
./name
```

If you type some integer and then press enter, then the program should produce
output. We can write both of these commands in a single line:

```
g++ name.cpp -o name && ./name
```

Note that `&&` ensures that `./name` only runs if `g++ name.cpp -o name`
finishes successfully.

### Redirecting Input & Output

If you want to read standard input from `inp.txt`, use the following:

```
./name < inp.txt
```

If you want to write standard output to `out.txt`, then use the following:

```
./name > out.txt
```

They can also be used in conjunction, as shown below:

```
./name < inp.txt > out.txt
```

See [Input & Output](/general/input-output) for how to do file input and output within the
program.

### [Compiler Options (aka Flags)](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html)

Use
[compiler flags](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/03/21/compiler-and-linker-flags-gcc/)
to change the way GCC compiles your code. Usually, we use something like the
following in place of `g++ name.cpp -o name`:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 name.cpp -o name -Wall
```

- `-O2` tells `g++` to compile your code to run more quickly while increasing
  compilation time (see
  [here](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/linux/gcc/gcc-o.html)).
- `-std=c++17` allows you to use features that were added to C++ in 2017. USACO
  recently upgraded from C++11 to C++17.
- `-Wall` checks your program for common errors. See
  [Debugging](/general/debugging-lang/#warning-options) for more information.

You should always compile with these flags.

## Mac-Specific

### Adding Shortcuts

<Info title="For Users of Linux & Windows">

The process is similar for Linux. If you're on Windows, you can use an IDE to
get these shortcuts, or you can install WSL (mentioned above).

</Info>

Retyping the flags above can get tedious. You should define shortcuts so you
don't need to type them every time!

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Jonathan Suh"
		url="https://jonsuh.com/blog/bash-command-line-shortcuts/"
		title="Aliases in Terminal"

	<Resource

		title="What should / shouldn't go in .zshenv, .zshrc, ..."
	 />
</Resources>

First, create your `.zshrc` if it doesn't already exist.

```
touch ~/.zshrc
```

Open your `.zshrc` with a text editor.

```
open ~/.zshrc
```

or some text editor (ex. sublime text with `subl`).

```
subl ~/.zshrc
```

You can add **aliases** and **functions** here, such as the following to compile
and run C++ on Mac.

```bash
co() { g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o "${1%.*}" $1 -Wall; }
run() { co $1 && ./${1%.*} & fg; }
```

Now you can easily compile and run `name.cpp` from the command line with
`co name.cpp && ./name` or `run name.cpp`. Note that all occurrences of `$1` in
the function are replaced with `name.cpp`, while `${1%.*}` removes the file
extension from `$1` to produce `name`.

### What is `& fg` for?

		title="Displaying or redirecting a shell's job control messages"
	/>
</Resources>

Let `prog.cpp` denote the following file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> v;
	cout << v[-1];
}
```

According to the resource above, the `& fg` is necessary for getting `zsh` on
Mac to display crash messages (such as segmentation fault). For example,
consider the running the first `prog.cpp` above with `run prog.cpp`.

If `& fg` is removed from the run command above then the terminal displays no
message at all. Leaving it in produces the following (ignore the first two
lines):

```
[2] 30594
[2]  - running    ./${1%.*}
zsh: segmentation fault  ./${1%.*}
```

### Measuring Time & Memory Usage

		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32515381/mac-os-x-usr-bin-time-verbose-flag"
	>
		use gtime
	</Resource>
</Resources>

For example, suppose that `prog.cpp` consists of the following:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int BIG = 1e7;
int a[BIG];

int main() {
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < BIG; ++i) sum += a[i];
	cout << sum;
}
```

Then `co prog.cpp && gtime -v ./prog` gives the following:

```
  Command being timed: "./prog"
  User time (seconds): 0.01
  System time (seconds): 0.01
  Percent of CPU this job got: 11%
  Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:00.22
  Average shared text size (kbytes): 0
  Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0
  Average stack size (kbytes): 0
  Average total size (kbytes): 0
  Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 40216
  Average resident set size (kbytes): 0
  Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 91
  Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 10088
  Voluntary context switches: 3
  Involuntary context switches: 38
  Swaps: 0
  File system inputs: 0
  File system outputs: 0
  Socket messages sent: 0
  Socket messages received: 0
  Signals delivered: 0
  Page size (bytes): 4096
  Exit status: 0
```

Note that $10^7$ integers require $4\cdot 10^7\cdot 10^{-3}\approx 40000$
kilobytes of memory, which is close to $40216$ in the above output as expected.

### Adjusting Stack Size

Let `A.cpp` denote the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int res(int x) {
	if (x == 200000) return x;
	return res(x+1);
}

int main() {
	cout << res(0) << "\n";
}
```

If we compile and run this with `g++ A.cpp -o A && ./A`, this outputs `200000`.
However, changing `200000` to `300000` gives a segmentation fault. Similarly,

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int arr[2000000];
	cout << arr[0] << "\n";
}
```

runs, but changing `2000000` to `3000000` also gives a segmentation fault. This
is because the **stack size** on Mac appears to be limited to 8 megabytes by
default.

Note that USACO does not have a stack size limit, aside from the usual 256 MB
memory limit. Therefore, code that crashes locally due to a stack overflow error
may still pass on the USACO servers. To get your code running locally, use one
of the methods below.

<Warning>

This matters particularly for contests such as
[Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup) where you submit the
output of a program you run locally.

</Warning>

#### Method 1

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13245019/how-to-change-the-stack-size-using-ulimit-or-per-process-on-mac-os-x-for-a-c-or"
		title="Change Stack Size on Mac OS?"
	/>
</Resources>

`ulimit -s 65532` will increase the stack size to about 64 MB. Unfortunately,
this doesn't work for higher numbers.

#### Method 2

	</Resource>
</Resources>

To get around this, we can pass a
[linker option](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html). According
to the manual for
[`ld`](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_mono/ld.html) (enter
`man ld` in Terminal), the option `-stack_size size` does the following:

> Specifies the maximum stack size for the main thread in a program. Without
> this option a program has a 8MB stack. The argument size is a hexadecimal
> number with an optional leading 0x. The size should be a multiple of the
> architecture's page size (4KB or 16KB).

So including `-Wl,-stack_size -Wl,0x10000000` as part of your compilation
command will set the maximum stack size to $16^7$ bytes $\approx$ $256$
megabytes, which is usually sufficient. However, running the first program above
with `200000` replaced by `1e7` still gives an error. In this case, you can
further increase the maximum stack size (ex. by adding another `0` to the end).

#### For Windows
Changing the stack size is relatively easy on Windows. Simply adding `-Wl,--stack,268435456` as a part of your compilation flags should do the trick. The `268435456` corresponds to `268435456` bytes, or `256` megabytes. If you are using Windows PowerShell, make sure to wrap it in quotations (like so: `"-Wl,--stack,268435456"`), since commas are considered to be special characters.
