## Installing `g++`

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=instructions) (and most contests)
use [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection)'s `g++` to
compile and run your code. You'll need `g++` specifically to use the
`#include <bits/stdc++.h>` header file; see
[Running Code Locally](/general/running-code-locally#including-bitsstdch) for
details.

### On Linux

GCC is usually preinstalled on most Linux distros. You can check if it is
installed with

```
whereis g++
```

If it is not preinstalled, you can probably install it using your distro's
package manager.

### On Mac

1.  Install XCode command line tools.

    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    If you previously installed these you may need to update them:

    ```bash
    softwareupdate --list # list updates
    softwareupdate -i -a # installs all updates
    ```

    After this step, `clang` should be installed (try running `clang --version`
    in Terminal).

2.  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

3.  Install `gcc` with Homebrew.

    ```
    brew install gcc
    ```

    According to
    [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30998890/installing-opencv-with-brew-never-finishes)
    if `brew` doesn't seem to finish for a long time then

    ```
    brew install gcc --force-bottle
    ```

    probably suffices.

4.  You should be able to compile with `g++-#`, where # is the version number
    (e.g., 10). Running the following command

    ```
    g++-10 --version
    ```

    should display something like this:

    ```
    g++-10 (Homebrew GCC 10.2.0_2) 10.2.0
    Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    ```

5.  If you want to be able to compile with just `g++`, write a shell alias! Put
    the following lines into your shell's rc file (`~/.bashrc` if you use
    `bash`, and `~/.zshrc` if you use `zsh`).

    ```bash
    alias g++=g++-10
    ```

    Once you do so, `g++ --version` should now output the same thing as
    `g++-10 --version`.

    Note: avoid overriding the system `g++` with symlinking or hard-linking as
    that will almost surely cause problems. Don't worry if you don't know what
    those terms mean.

### On Windows

#### Simpler: [Mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (Minimalist GNU for Windows)

#### Harder: [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)

If you're already accustomed to the Linux Command line, this might be the best
option for you.

Windows Subsystem for Linux, commonly referred to as WSL, runs the linux kernel
(or an emulation layer, depending on which version you use) within your windows
installation. This allows you to use Linux binaries without needing to use Linux
as your main Operating System.

Many people use WSL (such as Anthony), but it can be difficult to properly set
up.

		title="VSCode - GCC on WSL"
		url="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl"
	>
		difficult for beginners
	</Resource>
</Resources>

If you want to code in (neo)vim, you can install WSL and code through WSL bash.

To install the necessary tools after setting up WSL, you can run the following
commands.

On Debian based distributions like Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

On Arch based distributions like Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -Sy base-devel
```

You can find many tutorials on how to style up WSL and make it feel more cozy.
The first step is to use a proper terminal and not the default one that Windows
provides. An easy to use option is Windows Terminal, which can be found on the
[Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701).

## C++ with the Command Line

### Basics of Compiling & Running

Consider a simple program such as the following, which we'll save in `name.cpp`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x; cin >> x;
	cout << "FOUND " << x << "\n";
}
```

It's not hard to
[compile & run a C++ program](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-compile-and-run-the-Cplusplus-program).
First, open up Powershell on Windows, Terminal on Mac, or your distro's terminal
in Linux. We can compile `name.cpp` into an executable named `name` with the
following command:

```
g++ name.cpp -o name
```

Then we can execute the program:

```
./name
```

If you type some integer and then press enter, then the program should produce
output. We can write both of these commands in a single line:

```
g++ name.cpp -o name && ./name
```

Note that `&&` ensures that `./name` only runs if `g++ name.cpp -o name`
finishes successfully.

### Redirecting Input & Output

If you want to read standard input from `inp.txt`, use the following:

```
./name < inp.txt
```

If you want to write standard output to `out.txt`, then use the following:

```
./name > out.txt
```

They can also be used in conjunction, as shown below:

```
./name < inp.txt > out.txt
```

See [Input & Output](/general/input-output) for how to do file input and output
within the program.

### [Compiler Options (aka Flags)](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html)

Use
[compiler flags](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/03/21/compiler-and-linker-flags-gcc/)
to change the way GCC compiles your code. Usually, we use something like the
following in place of `g++ name.cpp -o name`:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 name.cpp -o name -Wall
```

- `-O2` tells `g++` to compile your code to run more quickly while increasing
  compilation time (see
  [here](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/linux/gcc/gcc-o.html)).
- `-std=c++17` allows you to use features that were added to C++ in 2017. USACO
  recently upgraded from C++11 to C++17.
- `-Wall` checks your program for common errors. See
  [Debugging](/general/debugging-lang/#warning-options) for more information.

You should always compile with these flags.

### Adding Shortcuts (Mac)

<Info title="For Users of Linux & Windows">

The process is similar for Linux. If you're on Windows, you can use an IDE to
get these shortcuts, or you can install WSL (mentioned above).

</Info>

Retyping the compiler flags above can get tedious. You should define shortcuts
so you don't need to type them every time!

<Resources>

		title="What should / shouldn't go in .zshenv, .zshrc, ..."
	/>
</Resources>

First, create your `.zshrc` if it doesn't already exist.

```
touch ~/.zshrc
```

Open your `.zshrc` with a text editor.

```
open ~/.zshrc
```

or some text editor (ex. sublime text with `subl`).

```
subl ~/.zshrc
```

You can add **aliases** and **functions** here, such as the following to compile
and run C++ on Mac.

```bash
co() { g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o "${1%.*}" $1 -Wall; }
run() { co $1 && ./${1%.*} & fg; }
```

Now you can easily compile and run `name.cpp` from the command line with
`co name.cpp && ./name` or `run name.cpp`. Note that all occurrences of `$1` in
the function are replaced with `name.cpp`, while `${1%.*}` removes the file
extension from `$1` to produce `name`.

#### What is `& fg` for?

Let `prog.cpp` denote the following file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> v;
	cout << v[-1];
}
```

According to the resource above, the `& fg` is necessary for getting `zsh` on
Mac to display crash messages (such as segmentation fault). For example,
consider the running the first `prog.cpp` above with `run prog.cpp`.

If `& fg` is removed from the run command above then the terminal displays no
message at all. Leaving it in produces the following (ignore the first two
lines):

```
[2] 30594
[2]  - running    ./${1%.*}
zsh: segmentation fault  ./${1%.*}
```

### Measuring Time & Memory Usage (Mac)

		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32515381/mac-os-x-usr-bin-time-verbose-flag"
	>
		use gtime
	</Resource>
</Resources>

For example, suppose that `prog.cpp` consists of the following:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int BIG = 1e7;
int a[BIG];

int main() {
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < BIG; ++i) sum += a[i];
	cout << sum;
}
```

Then `co prog.cpp && gtime -v ./prog` gives the following:

```
  Command being timed: "./prog"
  User time (seconds): 0.01
  System time (seconds): 0.01
  Percent of CPU this job got: 11%
  Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:00.22
  Average shared text size (kbytes): 0
  Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0
  Average stack size (kbytes): 0
  Average total size (kbytes): 0
  Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 40216
  Average resident set size (kbytes): 0
  Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 91
  Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 10088
  Voluntary context switches: 3
  Involuntary context switches: 38
  Swaps: 0
  File system inputs: 0
  File system outputs: 0
  Socket messages sent: 0
  Socket messages received: 0
  Signals delivered: 0
  Page size (bytes): 4096
  Exit status: 0
```

Note that $10^7$ integers require $4\cdot 10^7\cdot 10^{-3}\approx 40000$
kilobytes of memory, which is close to $40216$ in the above output as expected.

### Adjusting Stack Size (Mac)

<Warning>

This section might be out of date.

</Warning>

Let `A.cpp` denote the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int res(int x) {
	if (x == 200000) return x;
	return res(x+1);
}

int main() {
	cout << res(0) << "\n";
}
```

If we compile and run this with `g++ A.cpp -o A && ./A`, this outputs `200000`.
However, changing `200000` to `300000` gives a segmentation fault. Similarly,

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int arr[2000000];
	cout << arr[0] << "\n";
}
```

runs, but changing `2000000` to `3000000` also gives a segmentation fault. This
is because the **stack size** on Mac appears to be limited to 8 megabytes by
default.

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Wikipedia"
		url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow"
		title="Stack overflow"
	>
		explanation of the issue
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Note that USACO does not have a stack size limit, aside from the usual 256 MB
memory limit. Therefore, code that crashes locally due to a stack overflow error
may still pass on the USACO servers. To get your code running locally, use one
of the methods below.

<Warning>

This matters particularly for contests such as
[Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup) where you submit the
output of a program you run locally.

</Warning>

#### Method 1

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13245019/how-to-change-the-stack-size-using-ulimit-or-per-process-on-mac-os-x-for-a-c-or"
		title="Change Stack Size on Mac OS?"
	/>
</Resources>

`ulimit -s 65532` will increase the stack size to about 64 MB. Unfortunately,
this doesn't work for higher numbers.

#### Method 2

<Resources>

		source="CF"

	</Resource>
</Resources>

To get around this, we can pass a
[linker option](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html). According
to the manual for
[`ld`](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_mono/ld.html) (enter
`man ld` in Terminal), the option `-stack_size size` does the following:

> Specifies the maximum stack size for the main thread in a program. Without
> this option a program has a 8MB stack. The argument size is a hexadecimal
> number with an optional leading 0x. The size should be a multiple of the
> architecture's page size (4KB or 16KB).

So including `-Wl,-stack_size,0x10000000` as part of your compilation command
will set the maximum stack size to $16^7$ bytes $\approx 256$ megabytes, which
is usually sufficient. However, running the first program above with `200000`
replaced by `1e7` still gives an error. In this case, you can further increase
the maximum stack size (ex. changing `0x10000000` to `0xF0000000`).

On windows, adding `-Wl,--stack,268435456` as a part of your compilation flags
should do the trick. The `268435456` corresponds to `268435456` bytes, or `256`
megabytes. If you are using Windows PowerShell, make sure to wrap it in
quotations (like so: `"-Wl,--stack,268435456"`), since commas are considered to
be special characters.
