## Introductory Problems

The following require relatively little programming experience and no algorithmic knowledge.

<Problems problems={problems.general} />

Also check the [CSES Introductory Problems](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) up to and including "Palindrome Reorder." Once you're done with these, you should continue onto the rest of Bronze.

<Warning>

Some modules in the "General" section (ex. Fast Input & Output) are not relevant for USACO Bronze contestants. It is probably best to skip these for now and return to these later. <!-- However, make sure to check [Code Conventions](/general/code-con) for the templates that will be used for code snippets in later modules!
 -->

</Warning>
