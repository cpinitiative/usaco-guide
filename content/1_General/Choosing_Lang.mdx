## What Languages Does The USACO Support?

The most popular languages that USACO supports are
[C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),
[Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>), and
[Python 3](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>). C is
also supported, but it's essentially a strictly inferior version of C++ and
doesn't have the built-in data structures that are often used.

### What Are The Differences Between C++11 and C++17?

If you're just starting out, you probably won't be using any C++17-specific
features, so submitting in either C++11 or C++17 should suffice. For information
about the features introduced in C++11, C++14, and C++17, check the links below.

- [C++11 for Programming Contests](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/10124)
- [C++ Tricks (C++11 onwards)](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/15643)
- [C++14](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16262)
- [C++17](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57729)

### What Are The Differences Between Python 2 and Python 3?

As the link below mentions, there are many differences between Python 2 and 3.
Python 3 is newer and an overwhelming majority of USACO contestants use it over
Python 2.

- [Python 2 vs Python 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/important-differences-between-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-with-examples/)

## What Language Should I Start Out With?

In general, we recommend the following:

- If you already know one or more of these languages, just use the one you are
  most comfortable with.
- If you don't know any of these languages, you might as well start with C++, as
  C++ users generally don't need to worry as much about their solutions being a
  constant factor too slow. Furthermore, most modules currently lack Java and
  Python support.

Don't overthink choosing a language -- you can always change languages later!

## Can I Pass Every Problem in Every Language?

C++ is typically faster than Java, which in turn is typically faster than
Python. Although both Python and Java receive two times the C++ time limit in
USACO, this is not the case for most other websites (ex. Codeforces, CSES). Even
with the extended time limits, Python and Java sometimes have trouble passing.

- As of the 2022-23 season, USACO staff usually ensure that it is possible to
  receive full credit with all of C++, Python, and Java on Bronze and Silver
  problems. However, this is not guaranteed.
- Python is too slow for most Gold and Platinum problems.
- We don't have any examples of USACO problems that are impossible to pass with
  Java, though there are instances where the official C++ code is not fast
  enough to receive full credit if translated into equivalent Java code.

### Example - [Wormhole Sort](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=992) (USACO Silver Jan 2020)

The Java solution presented in the analysis requires over 3s to run (out of a
time limit of 4s).

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class wormsort {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("wormsort.in"));
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		loc = new int[n];
		component = new int[n];
		edges = new LinkedList[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) edges[i] = new LinkedList<>();
		lhs = new int[m];
		rhs = new int[m];
		weight = new int[m];
		st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			loc[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()) - 1;
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
			lhs[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()) - 1;
			rhs[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()) - 1;
			weight[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		}
		br.close();
		int minW = 0;
		int maxW = 1000000001;
		while (minW != maxW) {
			int mid = (minW + maxW + 1) / 2;
			if (valid(mid)) minW = mid;
			else maxW = mid - 1;
		}
		if (minW > 1e9) minW = -1;
		PrintWriter pw =
		    new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("wormsort.out")));
		pw.println(minW);
		pw.close();
	}
	static int[] loc, lhs, rhs, weight;
	static LinkedList<Integer>[] edges;
	static int[] component;
	private static void dfs(int curr, int label) {
		if (component[curr] == label) return;
		component[curr] = label;
		for (int child : edges[curr]) dfs(child, label);
	}
	private static boolean valid(int minW) {
		Arrays.fill(component, -1);
		for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) edges[i].clear();
		for (int i = 0; i < lhs.length; i++) {
			if (weight[i] >= minW) {
				edges[lhs[i]].add(rhs[i]);
				edges[rhs[i]].add(lhs[i]);
			}
		}
		int numcomps = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < component.length; i++) {
			if (component[i] < 0) { dfs(i, numcomps++); }
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < loc.length; i++) {
			if (component[i] != component[loc[i]]) return false;
		}
		return true;
	}
}
```

A comparable C++ solution runs in less than 800ms:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
vector<int> loc, lhs, rhs, weight;
vector<vector<int>> edges;
vector<int> component;

void dfs(int curr, int label) {
	if (component[curr] == label) return;
	component[curr] = label;
	for (int child : edges[curr]) dfs(child, label);
}

bool valid(int minW) {
	component.assign(n, -1);
	for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) edges[i].clear();
	for (int i = 0; i < lhs.size(); i++) {
		if (weight[i] >= minW) {
			edges[lhs[i]].push_back(rhs[i]);
			edges[rhs[i]].push_back(lhs[i]);
		}
	}
	int numcomps = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < component.size(); i++) {
		if (component[i] < 0) { dfs(i, numcomps++); }
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < loc.size(); i++) {
		if (component[i] != component[loc[i]]) return false;
	}
	return true;
}

int main() {
	freopen("wormsort.in", "r", stdin);
	cin >> n >> m;
	loc = vector<int>(n);
	component = vector<int>(n);
	edges = vector<vector<int>>(n);
	lhs = vector<int>(m);
	rhs = vector<int>(m);
	weight = vector<int>(m);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> loc[i];
		--loc[i];
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> lhs[i] >> rhs[i] >> weight[i];
		--lhs[i], --rhs[i];
	}
	int minW = 0;
	int maxW = 1000000001;
	while (minW != maxW) {
		int mid = (minW + maxW + 1) / 2;
		if (valid(mid)) minW = mid;
		else maxW = mid - 1;
	}
	if (minW > 1e9) minW = -1;
	freopen("wormsort.out", "w", stdout);
	cout << minW << "\n";
}
```

A comparable Python solution only passes the first five test cases:

```py
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)

sys.stdin = open("wormsort.in", "r")
sys.stdout = open("wormsort.out", "w")

n, m = map(int, input().split())
loc = [0] * n
component = [0] * n
edges = [[] for i in range(n)]

lhs = [0] * m
rhs = [0] * m
weight = [0] * m


def dfs(curr, label):
	if component[curr] == label:
		return
	component[curr] = label
	for child in edges[curr]:
		dfs(child, label)


def valid(minW):
	global component
	component = [-1] * n
	for i in range(n):
		edges[i].clear()
	for i in range(m):
		if weight[i] >= minW:
			edges[lhs[i]].append(rhs[i])
			edges[rhs[i]].append(lhs[i])
	numcomps = 0
	for i in range(n):
		if component[i] < 0:
			dfs(i, numcomps)
			numcomps += 1
	for i in range(n):
		if component[i] != component[loc[i]]:
			return False
	return True


loc = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - 1, input().split()))
for i in range(m):
	lhs[i], rhs[i], weight[i] = map(int, input().split())
	lhs[i] -= 1
	rhs[i] -= 1

minW = 0
maxW = 1000000001
while minW != maxW:
	mid = (minW + maxW + 1) // 2
	if valid(mid):
		minW = mid
	else:
		maxW = mid - 1

if minW > 1e9:
	minW = -1
print(minW)
```

It is possible to optimise this approach to pass all testcases. This takes
around 3.8s to run.

```py
def main():
	f = open("wormsort.in", "rb")
	n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
	loc = [*map(int, f.readline().split())]
	edges = [[] for _ in range(n)]
	weights = []

	def valid(loc, minW):
		component = [-1] * n
		numcomps = 0
		for i in range(n):
			if component[i] != component[loc[i] - 1]:
				return False
			elif component[i] == -1:
				todo = [i]
				component[i] = numcomps
				for node in todo:
					for child, weight in edges[node]:
						if component[child] == -1 and weight >= minW:
							component[child] = numcomps
							todo.append(child)
				numcomps += 1
		return True

	for line in f:
		a, b, w = map(int, line.split())
		edges[a - 1].append((b - 1, w))
		edges[b - 1].append((a - 1, w))
		weights.append(w)

	weights.sort()
	weights.append(10**9 + 1)

	lo, hi = 0, m + 1
	while lo != hi:
		mid = (lo + hi) // 2
		if valid(loc, weights[mid]):
			lo = mid + 1
		else:
			hi = mid

	open("wormsort.out", "w").write(f"{-1 if lo == m + 1 else weights[lo-1]}\n")


main()
```

Finally, the approach below uses DSU (a Gold topic), which takes around 1s to
run:

```py
# Author: Nicolas Hsu

file = open("wormsort.in")
N, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
P = tuple(map(int, ("0 " + file.readline()).split()))
W = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for i in range(M)]
W.sort(key=lambda w: -w[2])

par = list(range(N + 1))


def find(u):
	if par[u] == u:
		return u
	else:
		par[u] = find(par[u])
		return par[u]


w = -1
for n in range(1, N + 1):
	while find(n) != find(P[n]):
		w += 1
		par[find(W[w][1])] = find(W[w][0])

out = open("wormsort.out", "w")
out.write("-1" if w == -1 else str(W[w][2]))
out.close()
```

## What Am I Expected to Know?

You should know how to code in at least one of the languages listed above before
continuing onto the Bronze section of this guide. For a more detailed list on
what you should know, read the ["Expected Knowledge"](/general/expected) module.
