See [Working With MDX](/general/working-mdx) for additional information.

## Steps

1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)
    the GitHub repository.

2.  If it doesn't already exist, create a new `mdx` file in `solutions/`
    including frontmatter, e.g. the following in
    [`usaco-690.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/solutions/usaco-690.mdx):

    ```

    [Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_cowdance_silver_jan17.html)

    ## Explanation

    (add explanation here ...)

    Use `\texttt{}` around variable names with length *greater than one*, like so. Place long equations on separate lines with display math, and use `\cdot` instead of `*` to denote multiplication.

    $$
    \texttt{arr}[i]=2\cdot (a+b+c+d+e)+\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\texttt{arr}[j]
    $$

    Some additional text styles which you might consider using:

    http://latexref.xyz/Font-styles.html

    http://applied-r.com/latex-font-styles/

    $func(var)$

    $\textit{func(var)}$

    $\textrm{func(var)}$

    $\text{func(var)}$

    $\textsf{func(var)}$

    $\textbf{func(var)}$

    $\texttt{func(var)}$

    ## Implementation

    **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$

    ^ Format time complexity like this. Should appear outside of `<LanguageSection>` if it's the same for all implementations.

    If you need to link to a module, format your link like [this](/silver/binary-search) instead of [this](https://usaco.guide/silver/binary-search).

    <LanguageSection>

    <CPPSection>

    (add cpp code)

    </CPPSection>

    <PySection>

    (if you have Python code)

    </PySection>

    <JavaSection>

    (if you have Java code)

    </JavaSection>

    </LanguageSection>
    ```

    Keep file names and solution IDs consistent. In particular, the ID for a
    USACO problem (such as the one above) is the number at the very end of the
    URL on
    [usaco.org](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690). The
    name of a solution file should match the ID of the solution it contains. See
    [Working With MDX](/general/working-mdx#problem-lists) for more examples of
    IDs.

3.  Add your implementation, following these conventions
    [below](#code-conventions). It is **not** necessary to add an alternative
    implementation in the same language as the official implementation unless
    the alternative implementation takes a different approach or is better than
    the official one.

4.  In the module's `.problems.json` file (in this case,
    [`Binary_Search.problems.json`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/3_Silver/Binary_Search.problems.json)),
    change the `kind` of the `solutionMetadata` field to `internal` and remove
    all other fields. Also add tags (if you want). If the problem is not in a
    module, you can add the problem to
    [`extraProblems.json`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/extraProblems.json).

    ```
    {
      "uniqueId": "usaco-690",
      "name": "Cow Dance Show",
      "url": "http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690",
      "source": "Silver",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "isStarred": false,
      "tags": ["Binary Search", "Sorted Set"],
      "solutionMetadata": {
        "kind": "internal"
      }
    },
    ```

5.  Check that both the module and the solution render properly using the
    [live editor](/editor/) before submitting a
    [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Code Conventions

Since code for the USACO Guide is contributed from several authors, code style
will **not** be uniform. Of course, we still strive for code that is readable
and understandable. If any code does not compile or is hard to read, contact us.

Read our guidelines below before contributing code.

### General

- Use _tabs_ rather than spaces to indent.

  <Info title="Pro Tip">
  	If your code is indented with spaces, paste your code into the [Guide
  	Editor](/editor), right-click, click "Command Palette" from the menu that
  	pops up, and then search for "Convert Indentation to Tabs."
  </Info>

- In general, do not include unused code (e.g. "templates").
  - There are some exceptions to this guideline (e.g. when using the `Kattio`
    class for Java I/O). In this case, collapse it with a
    [`CodeSnip`](/general/working-mdx#code-blocks-and-code-snippets).
- Lines should not exceed 80 characters. If you need to, split comments across
  multiple lines to follow this rule.
- Use universally understandable variable names, especially for Bronze and
  Silver. Should be more descriptive than what you would normally use
  in-contest.
- Add comments throughout your code to explain your logic. Feel free to
  copy-paste the official USACO solution and improve it by adding more
  descriptive variable names and helpful comments. Though keep in mind the
  following guidelines from Google's
  [C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Comments):

  > But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is
  > self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much
  > better than using obscure names that you must then explain through comments.

  <br />

  > In general the actual name of the variable should be descriptive enough to
  > give a good idea of what the variable is used for.

  <br />

  > Self-describing code doesn't need a comment.

- Be _consistent_ about formatting your code, unlike the following snippet. We
  don't care about which one you use (`a+b` or `a + b`), but pick one and stick
  with it throughout your entire code.

  ```py
  a,b = (0,1)
  print(a+b)
  print(a + b)
  ```

- Don't repeat yourself.
  - [Rule Of Three](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)>)
- Once you've finished making the changes requested by a review, make sure to re-request the review.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### C++

- Do not use variable names that could conflict with `using namespace std`. For
  example, don't name a `std::set` "set."
- Do not use variable-length arrays as discussed
  [here](/bronze/intro-ds?lang=cpp#dynamic-arrays); they are not part of the C++
  standard.
- Do not include code that doesn't do anything. In particular,
  - Do not include `cout.tie(nullptr)` as discussed
    [here](/general/fast-io?lang=cpp#cintienullptr).
  - Do not include [optimization pragmas](/adv/vectorization) unless you show
    that they improve performance.
- For Bronze through Gold in particular, do not use additional macros
  (especially loop macros) beyond the ones listed below (see
  [Github #806](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues/806)):

  ```cpp
  CodeSnip{CPP Short Template}

  int main() {
    setIO();

  }
  ```

The C/C++ extension for
[Visual Studio Code](/general/running-code-locally?lang=cpp#resource-https%3A%2F%2Fcode.visualstudio.com%2F)
supports code formatting using `clang-format` (details
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-ide#_code-formatting)). To
indent using tabs, include the following in your
`C_Cpp.clang_format_fallbackStyle` setting.

```
{ UseTab: AlignWithSpaces, TabWidth: 4, IndentWidth: 4 }
```

You don't have to use a formatter, but doing so will ensure consistency across
the guide.

<JavaSection>

### Java

- Regarding I/O, `Scanner` is
  [significantly slower](/general/fast-io?lang=java#standard-io) than
  `BufferedReader` and should be avoided. You may use your own I/O template, but
  collapse it as described above.
- It is good practice to not use constant size arrays in Java.
- Use polymorphism when possible.
  - For example, `List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>()` instead of
    `ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>()`.

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

### Python

- Use `snake_case` to name variables in your code.
