See [Working With MDX](/general/working-mdx) for additional information.

## Steps

1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)
    the GitHub repository.

2.  If it doesn't already exist, create a new `mdx` file in `solutions/`
    including frontmatter, ex. the following in
    [`usaco-690.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/solutions/usaco-690.mdx):

    ```

    [Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_cowdance_silver_jan17.html)

    ## Explanation

    (add explanation here ...)

    Use `\texttt{}` around variable names with length *greater than one*, like so. Place long equations on separate lines with display math, and use `\cdot` instead of `*` to denote multiplication.

    $$
    \texttt{arr}[i]=2\cdot (a+b+c+d+e)+\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\texttt{arr}[j]
    $$

    Some additional text styles which you might consider using:

    http://latexref.xyz/Font-styles.html

    http://applied-r.com/latex-font-styles/

    $func(var)$

    $\textit{func(var)}$

    $\textrm{func(var)}$

    $\text{func(var)}$

    $\textsf{func(var)}$

    $\textbf{func(var)}$

    $\texttt{func(var)}$

    ## Implementation

    **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$

    ^ Format time complexity like this. Should appear outside of `<LanguageSection>` if it's the same for all implementations.

    <LanguageSection>

    <CPPSection>

    (add cpp code)

    </CPPSection>

    <PySection>

    (if you have Python code)

    </PySection>

    <JavaSection>

    (if you have Java code)

    </JavaSection>

    </LanguageSection>
    ```

    Keep file names and solution IDs consistent; namely, USACO IDs should
    correspond to the URL on
    [usaco.org](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690) and
    file names should be the same as the solution's ID.

3.  Add your implementation, following these conventions and the conventions
    [below](#code-conventions):

    - Use _tabs_ to indent.
    - Lines should not exceed 80 characters.
    - Be _consistent_ about formatting your code, unlike the following snippet.
      We don't care about which one you use (`a+b` or `a + b`), but pick one and
      stick with it!

      ```py
      a,b = (0,1)
      print(a+b)
      print(a + b)
      ```

    It is **not** necessary to add an alternative implementation in the same
    language as the official analysis (unless the alternative implementation
    takes a different approach or is written better / differently from the
    official implementation).

4.  In the module's `.problems.json` file (in this case,
    [`Binary_Search.problems.json`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/3_Silver/Binary_Search.problems.json)),
    change the `kind` of the `solutionMetadata` field to `internal` and remove
    all other fields. Also add tags (if you want). If the problem is not in a
    module, you can add the problem to
    [`extraProblems.json`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/extraProblems.json).

    ```
    {
      "uniqueId": "usaco-690",
      "name": "Cow Dance Show",
      "url": "http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690",
      "source": "Silver",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "isStarred": false,
      "tags": ["Binary Search", "Ordered Set"],
      "solutionMetadata": {
        "kind": "internal"
      }
    },
    ```

5.  Check that both the module and the solution render properly using the
    [live editor](/editor/) before submitting a
    [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Code Conventions

Since code for the USACO Guide is contributed from several authors, code style
will **not** be uniform. Of course, we still strive for code that is readable
and understandable. If any code does not compile or is hard to read, please
contact us.

Please read the following resource before contributing code (although you do not
have to follow all of the recommendations):

<!--

  url="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/notes/style"

### C++

For Bronze through Gold, please only use the macros listed in the template below
(see [Github #806](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues/806)):

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // see /general/running-code-locally
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

void setIO(string name = "") {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0); // see /general/fast-io
	if (sz(name)) {
		freopen((name+".in").c_str(), "r", stdin); // see /general/io
		freopen((name+".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
	}
}

int main() {
	setIO();

}
```

You don't have to use the template, but avoid using additional macros beyond the
ones listed above. In particular, for loop macros are highly discouraged.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

### Java

Regarding input and output, `Scanner` is
[significantly slower](/general/fast-io?lang=java#fast-input) than
`BufferedReader` and should be avoided.

To improve readability, Java solutions using `BufferedReader` should use a
wrapper class around input (preferably
[`Kattio`](/general/io?lang=java#io-template) for consistency, or use your own
variant if you really want).
