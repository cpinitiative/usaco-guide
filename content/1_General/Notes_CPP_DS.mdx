## `vector` Out Of Range

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> v(1,5), w(1,10);
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		cout << i << " " << w[i] << "\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) v[i] = i;
	cout << "---\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		cout << i << " " << w[i] << "\n";
}
```

produces the following output:

```
0 10
1 0
2 0
3 0
4 0
5 0
6 0
7 0
8 0
9 0
---
0 4
1 5
2 6
3 7
4 8
5 9
6 0
7 0
8 0
9 0
```

This is an example of
[buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow). Using
[vector::at](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/at/) instead of
[vector::operator[]](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/operator[]/)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> v(1,5), w(1,10);
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		cout << i << " " << w.at(i) << "\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) v.at(i) = i;
	cout << "---\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		cout << i << " " << w.at(i) << "\n";
}
```

will check the bounds and throw an exception instead:

```
0 10
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 1) >= this->size() (which is 1)
1 zsh: abort      ./$1 $@[2,-1]
```

## Unspecified Evaluation Order

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> res{-1};
int addElement() {
	res.push_back(-1);
	return res.size()-1;
}

int main() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
		res[i] = addElement();
		cout << i << " " << res[i] << "\n";
	}
}
```

Running the above code with C++17

```
g++ -std=c++17 bad.cpp -o bad && ./bad
```

gives the intended output:

```
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
```

But running with C++14

```
g++ -std=c++14 bad.cpp -o bad && ./bad
```

gives:

```
0 -1
1 -1
2 3
3 -1
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 -1
8 9
9 10
```

However, the code works correctly if you save the result of `addElement()` to an
intermediate variable.

```cpp
int main() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
		int tmp = addElement();
		res[i] = tmp;
		cout << i << " " << res[i] << "\n";
	}
}
```

<!-- See [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/83241) CF blog post and  -->

The problem is that `res[i] = addElement();` only works if `addElement()` is
evaluated before `res[i]` is. If `res[i]` is evaluated first, and _then_
`addElement()` results in the memory for `res` being reallocated, then `res[i]`
is invalidated. The order in which `res[i]` and `addElement()` are evaluated is
unspecified (at least before C++17).

StackOverflow post for some discussion about why this is the case (also a

You may come across this issue when trying to create a
[trie](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/83241#comment-705458).
