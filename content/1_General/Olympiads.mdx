> Hello, Which online judge should I practice more to do well in **IOI**?

<!-- > The closest OJ for IOI style? -->

[oj.uz](https://oj.uz/) is a great online judge that has most of the Olympiad
problems that you'll probably want to solve. However, other great online judges
with different Olympiad problems exist. Also, the
[OI Checklist](https://oichecklist.pythonanywhere.com/) is a great way to track
your progress.

Here is a list of major (inter)national Olympiads and the online judges where
you can solve problems from them. See the
[IOI members page](https://ioinformatics.org/page/members/7) for additional
links.
