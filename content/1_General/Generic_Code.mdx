## Templates

A **template** consists of code that is assumed to be in every file. Don't be
afraid to write your own template or don't use one at all! Below, we'll give an
example of what a template might look like.

<Warning>

USACO rules prohibit the use of pre-written code, including templates.
Therefore, make sure you are able to re-type your template in contest (or just
don't use one)!

</Warning>

Templates in C++ can take advantange of more powerful features (e.g. macros)
than the other contest languages, and they can be more customized to each
competitor.

**Generic code** is an important concept in informatics. Of course, as all
concepts go, you may dodge generic code and continue to write in a
hyper-specific style. As such, begin by questioning purpose.

Generic code is **adaptable**, meaning that it can be put to use immediately in
many ways without major changes. It can be reused, extended, and even versioned
powerfully to save time. Time is of essence in informatics, where I refer to
both algorithmic time _complexity_ and _coding_ time.

Even if you are writing a very specific data structure or algorithm, to truly
grasp it, a good contemplation is "Can I generalize what I have learned to a
broader class of problems?" Answer this by then attempting to generalize. That
said, before you proceed, I issue the below warning:

<Warning>

Generic code can easily assist **black-boxing**, where you write a snippet of
code such that you either forget its meaning or have no idea what it means in
the first place. This is a common pitfall, and you should avoid this as much as
possible if you truly want to grasp a concept in informatics.

</Warning>

Modern C++, a groundbreaking language in the current informatics scene, indeed
has several builtin features to support and streamline generic code. Here, we
will cover the basic important ones you will definitely want to add to your
coding arsenal.

## Classes

**Classes** are by far the most important utility in extensible code. If you
ever want to write a data structure that has several member functions to process
stored data, classes are for you. Of course, classes can have public and private
sections. For instance, consider a class `Human`, which maintains several
relevant member functions.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Human {
	private:  // internal properties
		int body_temp;
		int temper;
		string name;
	
	public:  // external reactions
		string get_name() {
			return name;
		}

		string get_feeling() {
			if (body_temp >= 97 && body_temp <= 99) {
				return "good";
			}
			return "bad";
		}

		string get_emotion() {
			if (temper <= 10) {
				return "sad";
			} else if (temper <= 30) {
				return "happy";
			}
			return "angry";
		}
};
```

But how do we actually use (and reuse) this class data structure we have
created? We do this by creating _instances_ of this class, concretely known as
**objects**.

Below is an example instance of the `Human` class named `sal`.

```cpp
Human sal;
```

Of course, we will want to initialize any object of this `human` class with its
fundamental attributes (`body_temperature` and `temper` from the above), but
the problem here is that we are unable to access them directly; they are private
and remain uninitialized.

To partially alleviate this, we can initialize variables in the class
declaration itself:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Human {
	private:  // internal properties
		int body_temp = 98;
		int temper = 25;
		string name = "Sal";
	
	public:  // external reactions
		string get_name() {
			return name;
		}

		string get_feeling() {
			if (body_temp >= 97 && body_temp <= 99) {
				return "good";
			}
			return "bad";
		}

		string get_emotion() {
			if (temper <= 10) {
				return "sad";
			} else if (temper <= 30) {
				return "happy";
			}
			return "angry";
		}
};
```

This gives us something to work with, and we can now create `sal` in `main()` as
well as call his member functions (instantiated directly from the base `Human`
class).

```cpp
int main() {
    Human sal;
	cout << sal.get_name()
		 << " feels " << sal.get_feeling()
		 << " and is " << sal.get_emotion()
		 << endl;
}
```

To completely solve this, we might be forced to make these variables public, but
instead we can be more clever and write a **constructor** function for this
class, essentially a function that is automatically called whenever an instance
of the class is created. Constructors are useful when we want to prevent
modification to variables we create but be able to initialize them for use,
making them naturally the most viable option for proprietary software companies.

We can create a constructor for the human class and require initialization of
the variables `body_temperature` and `temper`, which gives us some control over
`Sal`'s intrinsic properties as they are initialized. The overall code becomes:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Human {
	private:  // internal properties
		int body_temp;
		int temper;
		string name;
	
	public:  // external reactions
		Human(string name_, int body_temp_, int temper_) {
			name = name_;
			body_temp = body_temp_;
			temper = temper_;
		}

		string get_name() {
			return name;
		}

		string get_feeling() {
			if (body_temp >= 97 && body_temp <= 99) {
				return "good";
			}
			return "bad";
		}

		string get_emotion() {
			if (temper <= 10) {
				return "sad";
			} else if (temper <= 30) {
				return "happy";
			}
			return "angry";
		}
};

int main() {
    Human sal("Sal", 98, 25);
	cout << sal.get_name()
		 << " feels " << sal.get_feeling()
		 << " and is " << sal.get_emotion()
		 << endl;
}
```

This is immediately very extensible if we wish to create multiple instances of
`human`, all with their own initial properties. In fact, we can be even more
general by creating an external function condition that easily states feelings
and emotions for us without having to be rewritten.

```cpp
// Prints out the condition of a human to cout
void condition(Human h) {
	cout << h.get_name()
		 << " feels " << h.get_feeling()
		 << " and is " << h.get_emotion()
		 << endl;
}

int main() {
	Human sal("Sal", 98, 25);
	Human bob("Bob", 100, 9);
	Human joe("Joe", 85, 35);
	// Print out the conditions of all three people
	condition(sal);
	condition(bob);
	condition(joe);
}
```

As one very specific but useful note on constructors, when we wish to merely
initialize properties, we can adopt an alternative declaration that executes
significantly faster than the first; using the argument name as the variable
itself also becomes permissible and is guaranteed defined behavior:

```cpp
Human(string name, int body_temp, int temper) :
		name(name),
		body_temp(body_temp),
		temper(temper) { }
```

## Structs

**Structs** are useful when we care less about keeping private properties and
more about having just a general reusable data structure. This means everything
is public in a struct by default, and a `human` struct, along with the
reformatted constructor above, would look like:

```cpp
struct Human {
	int body_temp;
	int temper;
	string name;
	
	Human(string name_, int body_temp_, int temper_) {
		name = name_;
		body_temp = body_temp_;
		temper = temper_;
	}

	string get_name() {
		return name;
	}

	string get_feeling() {
		if (body_temp >= 97 && body_temp <= 99) {
			return "good";
		}
		return "bad";
	}

	string get_emotion() {
		if (temper <= 10) {
			return "sad";
		} else if (temper <= 30) {
			return "happy";
		}
		return "angry";
	}
};
```

Immediately, our struct is easier to manage given its open nature. It is more
integrated with the surrounding code, and we can do manipulations like the following:

```cpp
int main() {
	// Initialize Sal
	Human sal("Sal", 98, 25);
	condition(sal);  // Get Sal's initial condition
	sal.name = "Sally";  // Sal's friends sometimes call him Sally
	sal.body_temp = 102;  // Sal gets sick
	sal.temper = 40;  // He develops a bad temper due to his sickness
	condition(sal);  // Now we get Sal's new condition
}
```

Finally, we can choose to discard the constructor altogether and opt for an
initializer list based on the _order_ of the declaration of intrinsic variables.
In the `Human` case, the variables in order are `body_temp`, `temper`,
and `name`, so we can remove the constructor and opt for an initializer list
like:

```cpp
human Sal{98, 25, "Sal"};
```

Needless to say, all of this enables very clean initialization and manipulation
of classes and structs, integral to generic code.

## Templates

<Resources>
	<Resource

		url="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/131-function-templates/"
	/>
	<Resource

		title="13.3 - Template Classes"
		url="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/133-template-classes/"
	/>
</Resources>

The `Human` class example, though well-defined, was mostly intended to serve as
an example of the versatility of classes and structs. We now switch to something
simpler. Imagine a three-dimensional point in space as the following struct and
two of the said 3D points: `p1` and `p2`.

```cpp
struct Point3D {
	int x;
	int y;
	int z;
} p1{1, 2, 3}, p2{3, 4, 5};  // We can make some instances right before the ;
```

But what if we wanted to make a point `p3` with coordinates as doubles? We would
then be forced to create a secondary point struct `pt1`:

```cpp
struct Point3D {
	int x;
	int y;
	int z;
} p1{1, 2, 3}, p2{3, 4, 5};

struct Point3DDouble {
	double x;
	double y;
	double z;
} p3{1.1, 2.2, 3.3};
```

This might not seem too bad immediately, but imagine having to create structs
like this over and over again just to accommodate various type changes. We need
something better.

Lo and behold, we have the **template** to come to our rescue. We can use the format
`template<...>` to specify the specific templating conditions and then simply
define the struct normally. In particular, if we use a class `T`, we achieve:

```cpp
template<class T>
struct Point3D {
	T x;
	T y;
	T z;
};

Point3D<int> p1{1, 2, 3};
Point3D<int> p2{3, 4, 5};
Point3D<double> p3{1.1, 2.2, 3.3};
Point3D<long long> p4{
	9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807
};
```

It would be narrow-minded to think that templates are in any way limited to
classes and structs. They can be used with functions and much more. For example,
take a look at this function `ckmin`:

```cpp
/**
 * If b is less than a, this changes the value of a to that of b
 * and returns true. If not, the function simply returns false.
 */
template<class T>
bool ckmin(T& a, const T& b) {
	if (b < a) {
		a = b;
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
```

One interesting use case is that of the size of various containers. The size
member function of a container usually returns a type incompatible with `int`,
but we can easily write a templated function to fix this, handling all types
of containers at once:

```cpp
template<class T>
int sz(T container) {
	return (int) container.size();
}
```

You can call this through typing `sz<vector<int>>(v)` where `v` is a
`vector<int>`, but since C++11, functions (but not classes or structs
until C++14 and C++17) can actually infer template arguments, meaning
that we can simply use `sz(v)`!

What if we wanted to put multiple arguments in a template to handle multiple
classes? Consider the below secondary pair comparator struct as an example:

```cpp
struct CPS {
	template<class T, class U>
	bool operator() (const pair<T, U>& a, const pair<T, U>& b) {
		return make_pair(a.second, a.first) < make_pair(b.second, b.first);
	}
};
```

And in this design, since the template arguments both apply to only a function,
they can be easily inferred! For instance, declaring a set of
`pair<double, int>` in C++11 is as easy as `set<pair<double, int>, CPS>`.

What constitutes what other kinds of types we can put in templates? As a general
rule of thumb, until C++17, the types valid in template arguments are only
classes and fundamental types, of which only classes can be directly inferred in
many cases by functions.

In fact, we can even have templates that take a variable number of arguments,
known as variadic templates, or templates within templates, known as nested
templates, both of which are beyond the scope of this basic exposition but can
be found [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack) and
[here](https://blog.feabhas.com/2014/08/templates-of-templates/).

As a fun fact, just as templates give us so much control over the generality of
the language, a lot of the C++ standard in itself is written generically with
templates under the hood.

## Type Aliases With `using`

</Resources>

`typedef` is now rather outdated (though still used by some) because it is
more or less just an annoying version of `using` with frustrating semantics, so
we will not cover it here.

`using` is a fascinating keyword, frequently used to simplify namespace
prefixing when applicable. For instance, statements like

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

actually allow us to use an entire namespace. Of course, since
`using namespace std` is frequently limited to the competitive programming
community and looked down upon otherwise, we can use `using` to invoke better
simplifications.

Suppose that a lot of my code uses`std::cout`, which I find frustrating to type.
I can write

```cpp
using std::cout;
```

and then just live with `cout`. But what if I was using strings and wanted to
type neither `std::string` nor `string`? I could use `using` twice to fix this:

```cpp
using std::string;  // Unnecessary if already using namespace std
using str = string;  // Use str as an alias for string
```

Or I could compress this into a single statement:

```cpp
using str = std::string;  // str is an alias for std::string directly
```

We can make even more aliases, with even aliases within aliases (see `ll`),
for environments where speed is key, such as competitive programming:

```cpp
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using str = string;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;
using vi = vector<int>;
```

<Warning>

If you use too many type aliases or macros then your code will become unreadable
to anyone besides yourself!

</Warning>

Finally, we can take `using` to the next step and invoke templates! For
instance, if we want to be able to write `arr<int, 6>` instead of
`std::array<int, 6>`, we write:

```cpp
template<class T, int SZ> using arr = std::array<T, SZ>;
```

As another example, if we want to use `ai` to mean integer array, we can make
constructions like `ai<6>` work as well:

```cpp
template<int SZ> using ai = std::array<int, SZ>;
```

In general, it is important that `using` declarations have strong **scope**
guarantees, meaning that they will not work outside of their defined scope. To
use declarations everywhere in the program, they must be invoked in global
scope. But, if we want to be clever and create a reusable struct and just
specify template arguments internally, we always have the option of:

```cpp
struct Point {
	using T = int;
	/*
	 * Within this scope, T is an alias for int.
	 * Just change this declaration to change T's meaning within this struct
	 */
	T x;
	T y;
	T z;
};
```

In case we want to be able to access the specific type `T`'s alias meaning
outside of `Point`, this too becomes very easy:

```cpp
struct Point {
	using T = int;
	T x;
	T y;
	T z;
};

int main() {
	// U becomes a copy of T from Point's scope and is now in the scope of main
	using U = Point::T;
}
```

## Macros

We end this section off with `#define`, which is used to define **macros**.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="1.4 - Shortening Code" starred>
		simple examples of macros, describes a common bug
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="GCC"
		url="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html"

		title="2.10 - Intro to the Preprocessor"
	/>
</Resources>

`#define` is essentially a crude find-and-replace that happens before compile
time (in the preprocessor stage). In this sense, it is easy to use, where
`#define NAME VALUE` would ideally find all instances of `NAME` in the code and
replace them with `VALUE`.

This example defines `MOD` as `1e9 + 7` by find and replace.

```cpp
#define MOD 1e9 + 7

int main() {
	cout << int(MOD) << "\n";  // outputs 1000000007
	cout << int(MOD * 2) << "\n";  // outputs 1000000014
	cout << int(2 * MOD) << "\n";  // outputs 2000000007
}
```

But that's obviously not a good idea. A better alternative is the following:

```cpp
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
	cout << MOD << "\n";
}
```

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="LCPP"
		title="4.13 - Const, constexpr, symbolic constants"
		url="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/const-constexpr-and-symbolic-constants/"
	/>
</Resources>

Also, `using` is preferable to `#define`. For example, the following code with
`#define` will not compile (but it will with `using`).

```cpp
#define ll long long
// using ll = long long;

int main() {
	cout << ll(1e18);
}
```

The takeaway from this is to avoid `#define` when possible. Of course, some competitive
programmers use macros extensively. Some examples are presented below.

<!-- If you absolutely insist on using `#define` for some reason, though, use it with caution and remember to `#undef` for good scope control. -->

### Pairs

```cpp
using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define mp make_pair
#define f first
#define s second
```

It might be annoying to keep on typing `first` and `second`,
especially if you have nested pairs. These macros fix that.

### Vectors

```cpp
using vi = vector<int>;
#define sz(x) int((x).size())
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
```

We convert a size to a signed integer to avoid unsigned overflow, as
shown by this example:

```cpp
vi x;
cout << x.size() - 1 << "\n"; // otutputs 18446744073709551615 (incorrect)
cout << sz(x) - 1 << "\n"; // outputs -1 (correct)
```

`all(v)` makes sorting part or all of a vector a bit shorter.

```cpp
vi v{2, 4, 1, 5, 3};
sort(1 + all(v));  // v is now {2, 1, 3, 4, 5}
// This expands to sort(1 + begin(v), end(v));
sort(all(v));  // {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## Preprocessing Logic

<!-- As far as preprocessor magic goes, we are in no way limited to `#define` butchery.  -->

Ever wanted to write a program that compiles in different ways depending on some
initial conditions? We can use preprocessor directives like `#if` and `#else`,
or `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` to allow for this.

For instance, I may want my struct `Point` to be two-dimensional in some cases
and three-dimensional in others. I can do this like so:

```cpp
const bool d2 = false;  // false for 2D, true for 3D

template<class T>
struct Point {
	#if(d2)
		T x;
		T y;
	#else
		T x;
		T y;
		T z;
	#endif
};
```

If we are not opposed to using `#define`, we could use `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` to
see whether or not a macro is defined via `#define`.

```cpp
// #define 2D  // Uncomment to make Point 2D

template<class T>
struct Point {
	#ifdef 2D
		T x;
		T y;
	#else
		T x;
		T y;
		T z;
	#endif
}
```

There are many clever applications of this, including versioning. Importantly,
if we want code to run differently for different versions of C++, we can write:

```cpp
#if(__cplusplus < 201703L)
	/**
	 * "Clamps" v between the values of lo and hi if it's
	 * out of the bounds defined by those two values.
	 */
	template<class T>
	constexpr const T& clamp(const T& v, const T& lo, const T& hi) {
		assert(lo <= hi);
		if (v < lo) {
			return lo;
		} else if (hi < v) {
			return hi;
		}
		return v;
	}
#endif
```

## Namespaces

Finally, we can write our own namespaces to separate various functions. Within a
namespace, we can have functions, variables, classes, and even more namespaces.
Then, we can invoke `using` declarations to use the whole namespace.

```cpp
namespace test {
	const string greeting = "hi";
	namespace test1 {
		const int time = 2;
	} using namespace test1;

	template<class T> struct TestDS {
		T s;

		void add(T x) { s += x; }

		T get() { return s; }
	};
}
```

These are fairly self-explanatory, but a more rare feature of C++11 is the
`inline namespace`. Inline namespaces are not technically real namespaces but
allow us to chunk up code and avoid having to use namespaces just to gain
access.

```cpp
inline namespace test {
	const string greeting = "hi";
}
```

So why even have inline namespaces? We can use their features interestingly. For
instance, suppose we had a feature in an old version `v1` of a program but now
removed it in the new version `v2`.

```cpp
namespace v1 {
	const string buggy_feature = "bugs";
	const string greeting = "hi";
}

inline namespace v2 {
	// removed the buggy_feature from this new version
	const string buggy_feature = "what buggy feature?";
	const string greeting = "hi";
}

int main() {
	cout << buggy_feature << "\n";  // outputs "what buggy feature?"
	cout << v1::buggy_feature << "\n";  // outputs "bugs"
}
```

Now, not using a namespace will automatically use `v2`. But if we want access to
`v1` of the `buggy_feature`, we can simply write `v1::buggy_feature`. There you
have it, simple and effective version control!
