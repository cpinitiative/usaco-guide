<!-- We use `using namespace std;` so that we don't have to preface standard library functions with `std::` each time we use them. -->

The code snippets below will read in three integers as part of a single line and output their sum. For example, given the input

```
1 2 3
```

the output will be as follows:

```
sum is 6
```

Feel free to test them out at [ide.thecodingwizard.me](https://ide.thecodingwizard.me).

<Info title="Out of the methods below, which one should I use?">

It doesn't matter. Whichever you're most comfortable with!

</Info>

## Standard I/O

In most websites (such as CodeForces and CSES), input and output are **standard**.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### Method 1 - [`<iostream>`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/)

More straightforward to use. Calling the extraction operator `operator>>` on [`cin`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/cin/) reads whitespace-separated data from standard input. Similarly, calling the insertion operator `operator<<` on [`cout`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/cout/) writes to standard output. The [escape sequence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape) `\n` represents a new line.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int a, b, c; cin >> a >> b >> c;
	cout << "sum is " << a+b+c << "\n";
	// or cout << "sum is " << a+b+c << endl;
}
```

<Info title="endl vs \n">

[`endl`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/endl/) and `\n` are _not_ equivalent; see [Fast I/O](/general/fast-io) for details.

</Info>

### Method 2 - [`<cstdio>`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/)

This library includes the [`scanf`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/) and [`printf`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) functions, which are slightly more complicated to use.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int a, b, c;
	// %d specifies that a value of type int is being input.
	// Use %lld (a few judging platforms might need %I64d)
	// to input a long long (64-bit) integer.
	// Many other specifiers are also available; see link for more details.
	// Be sure to add a & character (address-of operator) when using
	// scanf, UNLESS you are inputing a string with %s.
	// It is possible to input multiple values at a time as shown below.
	scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);

	// Specifiers for printf are mostly the same as those used
	// by scanf, with the notable exception of floating-point numbers.
	// Use a backslash character followed by the lowercase
	// letter n to denote a newline.
	// The address-of operator, &, is not used here.
	printf("sum is %d\n", a+b+c);
}
```

<Info title="Input Speed">

The second method is significantly faster (generally only an issue with large input sizes). However, the first method can be sped up so that the difference in speed is not significant; see [Fast I/O](/general/fast-io) for details.

</Info>

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

### Method 1 - [`Scanner`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) and [`System.out.print`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html)

In your CS classes, you've probably implemented input and output using standard input and standard output, or using `Scanner` to read input and `System.out.print` to print output.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.print("sum is ");
		System.out.println(a + b + c);
	}
}
```

This works, but `Scanner` and `System.out.print` are slow when we have to handle inputting and outputting tens of thousands of lines.

### Method 2 - [`BufferedReader`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html) and [`PrintWriter`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html)

These are faster because they buffer the input and output and handle it all at once as opposed to parsing each line individually. However, `BufferedReader` is harder to use than `Scanner`. It has quite a few more methods and the `io` library must be imported for its use as well. A [`StringTokenizer`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/StringTokenizer.html) is used to split the input line by whitespace into tokens, which are then accessed individually by the `nextToken()` method.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {
	static BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	static PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(r.readLine());
		int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int c = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		pw.print("sum is ");
		pw.println(a + b + c);
		pw.close(); // make sure to include this line -- closes io and flushes the output
	}
}
```

#### I/O Template

The following template (a shortened version of Kattis's [`Kattio.java`](https://open.kattis.com/help/java)) combines `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` and takes care of the string processing for you.

<!-- 

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

class Kattio extends PrintWriter {
	private BufferedReader r;
	private StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer("");
	private String token;

	// standard input
	public Kattio() { this(System.in,System.out); }
	public Kattio(InputStream i, OutputStream o) {
		super(o);
		r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(i));
	}
	// USACO-style file input
	public Kattio(String problemName) throws IOException { 
		super(new FileWriter(problemName+".out"));
		r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(problemName+".in"));
	}

	private String peek() {
		if (token == null)
			try {
				while (!st.hasMoreTokens()) {
					String line = r.readLine();
					if (line == null) return null;
					st = new StringTokenizer(line);
				}
				token = st.nextToken();
			} catch (IOException e) { }
		return token;
	}
	public boolean hasMoreTokens() { return peek() != null; }
	public String next() {
		String ans = peek(); 
		token = null;
		return ans;
	}
	
	public int nextInt() { return Integer.parseInt(next()); }
	public double nextDouble() { return Double.parseDouble(next()); }
	public long nextLong() { return Long.parseLong(next()); }
}

public class Main {
	static Kattio io = new Kattio();
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = io.nextInt();
		int b = io.nextInt();
		int c = io.nextInt();
		io.print("sum is ");
		io.println(a + b + c);
		io.close(); // make sure to include this line -- closes io and flushes the output
	}
}
``` -->

```java
/** Simple yet moderately fast I/O routines.
 * Some notes:
 *
 * - When done, you should always do io.close() or io.flush() on the
 *   Kattio-instance, otherwise, you may lose output.
 *
 * - The nextInt(), nextDouble(), and nextLong() methods will throw an
 *   exception if there is no more data in the input.
 *

import java.io.*;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

class Kattio extends PrintWriter {
	private BufferedReader r;
	private StringTokenizer st;

	// standard input
	public Kattio() { this(System.in,System.out); }
	public Kattio(InputStream i, OutputStream o) {
		super(o);
		r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(i));
	}
	// USACO-style file input
	public Kattio(String problemName) throws IOException {
		super(new FileWriter(problemName+".out"));
		r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(problemName+".in"));
	}

	// returns null if no more input
	public String next() {
		try {
			while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens())
				st = new StringTokenizer(r.readLine());
			return st.nextToken();
		} catch (Exception e) {}
		return null;
	}

	public int nextInt() { return Integer.parseInt(next()); }
	public double nextDouble() { return Double.parseDouble(next()); }
	public long nextLong() { return Long.parseLong(next()); }
}

public class Main {
	static Kattio io = new Kattio();
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = io.nextInt();
		int b = io.nextInt();
		int c = io.nextInt();
		io.print("sum is ");
		io.println(a + b + c);
		io.close(); // make sure to include this line -- closes io and flushes the output
	}
}
```

<Optional title="extends">

`extends` is used so that `Kattio` inherits methods from `PrintWriter` (including `print()`, `println()` and `close()`). If you're interested, see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_extends.asp) for more details.

</Optional>

The input methods in our `Kattio` class mimic those of `Scanner`. Given an instance `io`:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `io.next()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns a `String` |
| `io.nextInt()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as an `int` |
| `io.nextLong()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as a `long` |
| `io.nextDouble()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as a `double` |
| `io.print(arg)` | Prints `arg` to designated output stream |
| `io.println(arg)` | Prints `arg` to designated output stream and adds a newline |
| `io.close()` | Closes the output stream and flushes the output. Make sure to call this (or [`io.flush()`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html#flush()>)) at the end, or you won't see any output! |

USACO prohibits prewritten code but allows you to consult resources about basic functionality such as input / output. So feel free to refer to this module during a USACO contest.

<Info title="PrintWriter Buffering">

The original `Kattio` code had `super(new BufferedOutputStream(o));` on line 37. But since `PrintWriter` [uses buffered output](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32177690/is-printwriter-buffered), including `BufferedOutputStream` is necessary.

Similarly, you may see `PrintWriter`s for file output initialized like the following (ex. [here](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_circlecross_bronze_feb17.html)).

```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("problemname.out")));
```

but

```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("problemname.out"));
```

suffices.

<Info title="Input Speed">

See [Fast I/O](/general/fast-io) for a comparison of input speeds as well as a faster method of input.

<PySection>

### Python

The most intuitive way to do input/output is using the built in [`input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) and [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) methods. The `input()` method will return the next line, and can be processed using different python methods. The `print()` method takes in a string and an optional string `end` (defaults to `'\n'`). Below is an annotated demonstration on different input/output scenarios.

```py
# read in a string
myStr = input()
# prints the string on its own line
print(myStr)

# take in an integer n on a single line
n = int(input())
# prints integer n with " test" after it
print(n, end=" test")
```

We can also [`split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) along with [`map`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) or a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to read in multiple integers on the same line (separated by whitespace).

```py
# read in a series of numbers on one line into a list
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
# does the same thing
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

We can use something similar to the above if we are unpacking a fixed number of integers.

```py
# read in integers n and m, both on the same line
n, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
# does the same thing
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

So taking three integers as input and printing their sum is quite simple:

```py
a,b,c = map(int, input().split())
print("sum is",a+b+c)
```

## File I/O

<Info title="Update">

USACO problems from December 2020 onwards use standard I/O rather than file I/O. You'll still need to use file I/O to submit to earlier problems.

</Info>

In older USACO problems, the input and output file names are given and follow the convention `problemname.in`. After the program is run, output must be printed to a file called `problemname.out`.

<FocusProblem problem={problems.fence} />

You must rename the `.in` and `.out` files depending on the problem. For example, in the above problem you would use `paint.in` and `paint.out`.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### Method 1 - [`freopen`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/freopen/)

You will need the `<cstdio>` library. The `freopen` statements reuse standard I/O for file I/O. Afterwards, you can simply use `cin` and `cout` (or `scanf` and `printf`) to read and write data.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("problemname.in", "r", stdin);
	// the following line creates/overwrites the output file
	freopen("problemname.out", "w", stdout);
	// cin reads from the file instead of standard input
	int a, b, c; cin >> a >> b >> c;
	// cout prints to the file instead of standard output
	cout << "sum is " << a+b+c << "\n";
}
```

To test your solution locally without file I/O, just comment out the lines with `freopen`.

For convenience, we can define a function that will redirect `stdin` and `stdout` based on the problem name:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

void setIO(string s) { // the argument is the filename without the extension
	freopen((s+".in").c_str(),"r",stdin);
	freopen((s+".out").c_str(),"w",stdout);
}

int main() {
	setIO("problemname");
	int a, b, c; cin >> a >> b >> c;
	cout << "sum is " << a+b+c << "\n";
}
```

### Method 2 - [`<fstream>`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/)

You cannot use C-style I/O (`scanf`, `printf`) with this method.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ifstream fin("problemname.in");
	ofstream fout("problemname.out");
	int a, b, c; fin >> a >> b >> c;
	fout << "sum is " << a+b+c << "\n";
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

### Java

Again, `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` should be used. Note how `static` initialization of `r` and `pw` is slightly different.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {
	static BufferedReader r;
	static PrintWriter pw;
	static {
		try {
			r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("problemname.in"));
			pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("problemname.out"));
		} catch (IOException e) {}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(r.readLine());
		int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int c = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		pw.print("sum is ");
		pw.println(a + b + c);
		pw.close(); // make sure to include this line -- closes io and flushes the output
	}
}
```

#### With `Kattio`

```java
// Kattio template code above

public class Main {
	static Kattio io;
	static {
		try {
			io = new Kattio("problemname");
		} catch(IOException e) {}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = io.nextInt();
		int b = io.nextInt();
		int c = io.nextInt();
		io.print("sum is ");
		io.println(a + b + c);
		io.close(); // make sure to include this line -- closes io and flushes the output
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

### Python

See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) for documentation about file I/O.

The most intuitive way to do file I/O in Python is by redirecting the system input and output to files. After doing this, you can then use the above `input()` and `print()` methods as usual.

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open("problemname.in", "r")
sys.stdout = open("problemname.out", "w")
```

	c, d = map(int,lines[1].split())
	for i in range(a, b):
		cover[i] = 1
	for i in range(c, d):
		cover[i] = 1
	ans = 0
	for i in range(100):
		ans += cover[i]
	with open('paint.out','w') as out:
		print(ans,file=out)
		# or out.write(str(ans))
```

### Method 2

Redirecting file input using `sys`, as mentioned above.

<Spoiler title="Method 2">

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open("paint.in", "r")
sys.stdout = open("paint.out", "w")
cover = [0] * 100
a, b = map(int, input().split())
c, d = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(a, b):
	cover[i] = 1
for i in range(c, d):
	cover[i] = 1
ans = 0
for i in range(100):
	ans += cover[i]
print(ans)
```

## USACO Note - Extra Whitespace

Importantly, USACO will automatically add a newline to the end of your file if it does not end with one.

<Warning>

Occasionally, there is a period of time near the beginning of the contest window where the model outputs do not end in newlines. This renders the problem unsolvable ...

</Warning>

Make sure not to output trailing spaces, or you will get an error such as the following:

![bad](Error.png)

Here are some examples of what is allowed and what isn't when the intended output consists of a single integer `ans`:

### C++

```cpp
cout << ans; // OK, no newline
cout << ans << endl; // OK, newline
cout << ans << "\n"; // OK, newline
cout << ans << " "; // NOT OK, extra space
cout << ans << "\n\n"; // NOT OK, extra newline
```

</CPPSection>

### Java

```java
pw.print(ans); // OK, no newline
pw.println(ans); // OK, newline
pw.print(ans+"\n"); // OK, newline
pw.print(ans+" "); // NOT OK, extra space
pw.print(ans+"\n\n") // NOT OK, extra newline
```

### Python

```py
print(ans) # OK, newline
print(ans,end='') # OK, no newline
print(str(ans)+'\n') # NOT OK, extra newline
```
