<!-- We use `using namespace std;` so that we don't have to preface standard library functions with `std::` each time we use them. -->

## Standard I/O

In most websites (such as CodeForces and CSES), input and output are **standard**.

<FocusProblem problem={problems.cses[0]} />

<Info title="Out of the methods below, which one should I use?">

Whichever you're most comfortable with!

</Info>

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### Method 1: [<iostream\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x; cin >> x;
	cout << "FOUND " << x << "\n";
}
```

### Method 2: [<cstdio\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/)

This library includes the `scanf` and `printf` functions, which are slightly more complicated to use, but are significantly faster (generally only an issue with large input sizes):

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x, y;
	// %d specifies that a value of type int is being input.
	// Use %lld (a few judging platforms might need %I64d)
	// to input a long long (64-bit) integer.
	// Many other specifiers are also available; see link for more details.
	// Be sure to add a & character (address-of operator) when using
	// scanf, UNLESS you are inputing a string with %s.
	// It is possible to input multiple values at a time as shown below.
	scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);

	// Specifiers for printf are mostly the same as those used
	// by scanf, with the notable exception of floating-point numbers.
	// Use a backslash character followed by the lowercase
	// letter n to denote a newline.
	// The address-of operator, &, is not used here.
	printf("Found %d and %d\n", x, y);
}
```

The first method can be sped up so that the difference in speed is not significant; see [Fast I/O](/general/fast-io) for details.

### Java

In your CS classes, you've probably implemented input and output using standard input and standard output, or using [`Scanner`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) to read input and [`System.out.print`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html) to print output. These methods work, but `Scanner` and `System.out.print` are slow when we have to handle inputting and outputting tens of thousands of lines. Thus, we use [`BufferedReader`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html) and [`PrintWriter`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html) instead, which are faster because they buffer the input and output and handle it all at once as opposed to parsing each line individually.

Here is a Java template for input and output that which combines `BufferedReader` and `Printwriter`, based off Kattis's [`Kattio.java`](https://open.kattis.com/help/java). Input is done similarly to `Scanner`. Note that we import the entire `util` and `io` libraries for ease of use. 

This example takes three numbers as input and prints their sum. Make sure that [`io.close()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html#close()) is called at the end, or you won't see any output!

```java
/** Simple yet moderately fast I/O routines.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * Kattio io = new Kattio();
 *
 * while (io.hasMoreTokens()) {
 *    int n = io.nextInt();
 *    double d = io.nextDouble();
 *    double ans = d*n;
 *
 *    io.println("Answer: " + ans);
 * }
 *
 * io.close();
 *
 *
 * Some notes:
 *
 * - When done, you should always do io.close() or io.flush() on the
 *   Kattio-instance, otherwise, you may lose output.
 *
 * - The nextInt(), nextDouble(), and nextLong() methods will throw an
 *   exception if there is no more data in the input, so it is generally
 *   a good idea to use hasMoreTokens() to check for end-of-file.

A brief description of the methods in our `Kattio` class, with an instance `io`:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `io.next()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns a `String` |
| `io.nextInt()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as an `int` |
| `io.nextLong()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as a `long` |
| `io.nextDouble()` | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as a `double` |
| `io.println()` | Prints the argument to designated output stream and adds a newline |
| `io.print()` | Prints the argument to designated output stream |

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

The most intuitive way to do input/output is using the built in [`input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) and [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) methods. The `input()` method will return the next line, and can be processed using different python methods. The `print()` method takes in a string and an optional string `end` (defaults to `'\n'`). Below is an annotated demonstration on different input/output scenarios.

```py
# read in a string
myStr = input()
# prints the string on its own line
print(myStr)

# take in an integer n on a single line
n = int(input())
# prints integer n with " test" after it
print(n, end=" test")
```

We can also [`split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) along with [`map`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) or a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to read in multiple integers on the same line (separated by whitespace).

```py
# read in a series of numbers on one line into a list
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
# does the same thing
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

We can use something similar to the above if we are unpacking a fixed number of integers.

```py
# read in integers n and m, both on the same line
n, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
# does the same thing
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

## File I/O

<FocusProblem problem={problems.fence[0]} />

In USACO, input is read from a file called `problemname.in`. After the program is run, output must be printed to a file called `problemname.out`. Note that you'll have to rename the `.in` and `.out` files depending on the problem. For example, in the above problem you would use `paint.in` and `paint.out`.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### Method 1: `freopen`

You will need the [<cstdio\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/) library.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("problemname.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("problemname.out", "w", stdout);
	// rest of your code ...
	// can use cin or scanf
}
```

### Method 2: [`<fstream>`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/)

You cannot use C-style I/O (`scanf`, `printf`) with this method.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ifstream fin("problemname.in");
	ofstream fout("problemname.out");
	// rest of your code ...

}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

You may see `PrintWriter`s initialized like the following (ex. [here](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_circlecross_bronze_feb17.html)).

```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("problemname.out")));
```

There is no need to include `BufferedWriter` since `PrintWriter` [uses buffered output](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32177690/is-printwriter-buffered). Anyways, the provided constructor in `Kattio` handles this for you.

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) for documentation about file I/O.

The most intuitive way to do file I/O in Python is by redirecting the system input and output to files. After doing this, you can then use the above `input()` and `print()` methods as usual.

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open("problemname.in", "r")
sys.stdout = open("problemname.out", "w")
```

</PySection>

	</Resource>
</Resources>

<br />

Importantly, USACO will automatically add a newline to the end of your file if it does not end with one. Make sure not to output trailing spaces, or you will get an error such as the following:

![bad](Error.png)

For an explanation of the solutions below, check the [Rectangle Geometry](/bronze/rect-geo#example---fence-painting) module.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### Method 1

Use [freopen](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/freopen/). If you comment out both of the lines containing `freopen` then the program reads from standard in and writes to standard out as usual.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("paint.in","r",stdin);
	// reuse standard in to read from "paint.in"
	freopen("paint.out","w",stdout);
	// reuse standard out to write to "paint.out"
	vector<bool> cover(100);
	int a, b, c, d; cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
	for (int i = a; i < b; ++i) cover[i] = 1;
	for (int i = c; i < d; ++i) cover[i] = 1;
	int ans = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) ans += cover[i];
	cout << ans;
	// cout << ans << endl; is OK
	// cout << ans << "\n"; is OK
	// cout << ans << " "; is NOT OK
	// cout << ans << "\n\n"; is NOT OK
}
```

### Method 2

Use [ifstream & ofstream](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/).

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ifstream fin("paint.in");
	ofstream fout("paint.out");
	vector<bool> cover(100);
	int a, b, c, d; fin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
	for (int i = a; i < b; ++i) cover[i] = 1;
	for (int i = c; i < d; ++i) cover[i] = 1;
	int ans = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) ans += cover[i];
	fout << ans;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

### Method 1 - `Scanner`

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class template {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
		Scanner r = new Scanner(new File("paint.in"));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("paint.out"));

		int a = r.nextInt(), b = r.nextInt();
		int c = r.nextInt(), d = r.nextInt();

		int[] cover = new int[100];
		for (int i = a; i < b; i++) cover[i] = 1;
		for (int i = c; i < d; i++) cover[i] = 1;
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) ans += cover[i];

		pw.println(ans);
		pw.close(); // flush output
	}
}
```

### Method 2 - `BufferedReader`

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class paintSol { // must be declared in paintSol.java
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("paint.in"));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("paint.out"));
		int[] cover = new int[100];

		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int c = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), d = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

		for (int i = a; i < b; i++) cover[i] = 1;
		for (int i = c; i < d; i++) cover[i] = 1;
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) ans += cover[i];
		pw.println(ans);
		pw.close(); // make sure to include this line -- flushes the output.
	}
}
```

### Method 3 - `Kattio`

Note how the initialization of `io` is slightly different compared to standard input / output since we need to catch [`IOException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/IOException.html).

```java
// Kattio template code above

public class Main {
	static Kattio io;
	static {
		try {
			io = new Kattio("paint");
		} catch(IOException e) {}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = io.nextInt(), b = io.nextInt();
		int c = io.nextInt(), d = io.nextInt();

		int[] cover = new int[100];
		for (int i = a; i < b; i++) cover[i] = 1;
		for (int i = c; i < d; i++) cover[i] = 1;
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) ans += cover[i];

		io.println(ans);
		io.close(); // flush output
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Redirecting file input using `sys`,

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open("paint.in", "r")
sys.stdout = open("paint.out", "w")
cover = [0] * 100
a, b = map(int, input().split())
c, d = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(a, b):
	cover[i] = 1
for i in range(c, d):
	cover[i] = 1
ans = 0
for i in range(100):
	ans += cover[i]
print(ans)
```

Alternatively,

```py
with open('paint.in','r') as inp:
	cover = [0] * 100
	lines = [line for line in inp]
	a, b = map(int,lines[0].split())
	c, d = map(int,lines[1].split())
	for i in range(a, b):
		cover[i] = 1
	for i in range(c, d):
		cover[i] = 1
	ans = 0
	for i in range(100):
		ans += cover[i]
	with open('paint.out','w') as out:
		print(ans,file=out)
		# or out.write(str(ans))
```
