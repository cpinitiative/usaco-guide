## Expected Knowledge

<Info title="What if I'm not comfortable with basic coding (yet)?">

Check [our resources page](/general/resources-learning-to-code)!

</Info>

This guide assumes you know the following topics in either C++, Java, or Python:

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If / Else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

<CPPSection>

<Info title="Pro Tip">

For C++, knowledge of pointers, `struct`s and `class`es is useful but not
required.

</Info>

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>
In particular, contestants using Java should be familiar with roughly the first
half of AP Computer Science A.

## Getting Started

It's probably best to start with shorter problems than those you typically find
in USACO Bronze. The following resources may be helpful for familiarizing
yourself with your language of choice.

<!-- Resources below (including starred ones) are optional. -->

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="CodeSignal"
		title="Arcade, Interview Practice"
		url="https://app.codesignal.com/"
	>
		no need to handle input or output
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="VPlanet"
		title="Learn to Code"
		url="https://www.vplanetcoding.com/course1"
	>
		basic problemsets with and without nested loops
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="CSES"
		title="Introductory Problems"
		url="https://cses.fi/problemset/list/"
	>
		up to and including "Palindrome Reorder"
	</Resource>
</Resources>

## Introductory USACO Bronze Problems

<!-- The following problems require relatively little programming experience and no algorithmic knowledge. -->

<Problems problems="general" />

Once you're done with these, you should continue onto the rest of Bronze.

<Warning>

Some modules in the "General" section (ex. Fast Input & Output) are not relevant
for USACO Bronze. You should skip these for now and return to these later.

<!-- However, make sure to check [Code Conventions](/general/code-con) for the templates that will be used for code snippets in later modules!
 -->

</Warning>
