title: Introducing Modules

description: How each module is structured.
prerequisites:
  - using-this-guide

There are six **sections** in the guide: Intro, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum,
and Advanced. Each section is subdivided into **categories**, which is just a
group of modules. Each **module** (such as the one you're reading right now)
represents one "article" or "page" on the site. A module generally consists of
three parts:

1. **Lesson**: Introduces the concept via a focus problem.
2. **Implementations**: Solutions to the focus problem.
3. **Practice Problems**: Teach you how to apply the concept to various
   problems.

Some relatively rare modules are prefixed with "optional." It's not essential to
work through these if your goal is just to pass the corresponding division. They
might be referenced in later divisions.

## Lesson

The lesson is a curated collection of external resources, problems, and
supplementary text we've written ourselves.

- We'll link to online resources that already exist whenever possible.
- The goal is to introduce you to the concept.
- Everything is meant to be completed in order.
- It usually begins with at least one **focus problem.**
  - The focus problem is a direct application of the concept, and is useful in
    testing your implementation.
- We'll **star** external resources that we highly recommend you read. Feel free
  to read the others if you don't understand something. If multiple modules
  cover essentially the same material, at most one should be starred.

## Implementations

Usually the lesson is followed by an implementation of the solution to the focus
problem.

- C++ code will always be provided.
- Java code will be provided (at least) for Bronze to Gold.
- Python code will be provided (at least) for Bronze and some of Silver.

Example input / output will be provided if not already contained within the
statement of the focus problem.

## Practice Problems

After reading the module lesson, you'll be given a lot of problems (from various
sources, not just USACO) to practice applying the concept you've learned.

- The problems are roughly sorted in order of how they are recommended to be
  completed.
- You don't have to solve every problem, just enough to feel comfortable with
  the module. We've starred the ones we found most interesting.

Please let us know if the problem is not a good example of the corresponding
topic!

### Problem Editorials

We'll try our best to write full editorials for problems which don't have them
(or if existing editorials are poorly written). _Starred problems will generally
have better editorials._ If you believe an editorial is needed for a problem,
please let us know using the "Contact Us" button.

<Warning>

A lot of current sketches are not actually useful.

### Problem Difficulty (Bronze to Gold)

Difficulty represents how challenging a problem is expected to be to someone
after they read through the module, **not** how difficult the problem is in
general. Therefore, it is **not** comparable across modules (even of the same
division).

Difficulty ranges from **Very Easy** to **Insane**.

- **Very Easy** problems are related to the module, but you should be able to do
  them relatively quickly before reading the resources.
- **Easy** problems can be solved relatively quickly by someone who is familiar
  with the module, and they should be approachable by someone who has just
  finished reading the starred resources.
- **Normal** problems require a bit more thinking.
- **Hard** problems may require a lot (?) of time to approach.
- **Very Hard** problems challenge even the strongest contestants in the
  corresponding division. Often require multiple levels of observation and more
  knowledge than provided by the module.
- **Insane** problems shouldn't appear on a (reasonable) contest of the
  corresponding division. Don't worry about solving these until you've reached a
  higher division.

### Conventions for Sources and Tags

 - Follow the format of existing sources and tags from the [problems page](/problems/).
 - Split separate tags into separate strings (e.g., `['Meet in the Middle', 'DP']` rather than `['Meet in the Middle, DP']`).
 - Some sources are automatically assigned [tooltips](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/src/models/problem.ts) that display when hovered over. For a source not automatically assigned a tooltip, you can give it one by specifying `sourceDescription`.

## Custom Components

Sometimes modules will contain custom components. Here are some of the more
common ones.

<Spoiler title="Hidden Content">

In some modules, codes or solutions will be placed in **spoiler blocks** like
this. In these cases, you should think about the problem or try to implement it
yourself before revealing the solution or code.

<Optional title="Optional Content">

Not all content in this guide is essential to competitive programming. Skipping
over optional content is fine, but if you're interested, feel free to explore
further as well.

Pay attention to content within warning blocks!
