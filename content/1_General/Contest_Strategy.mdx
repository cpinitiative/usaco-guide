description: General ideas on how to strategize during a USACO contest.

The best contest strategy is to go in knowing everything. However, only few
people can do this; see [Benq](https://codeforces.com/profile/benq) or
[tmw](https://codeforces.com/profile/tmwilliamlin168) (I kid).

Once the timer starts, there's no more studying you can do, and managing your
time wisely is the best thing you can do to maximize your score.

## Strategy

Strategy is flexible and all advice should be taken with a grain of salt.
Strategy should be personal to _you_ specifically.

### The beginning of a contest

You should read _all_ the problems first (don't give up on any problems
prematurely). Generally, a lot of thinking should happen before any coding.
Depending on the difficulty of a contest, you can spend anywhere from 5 minutes
to 2 hours with a pencil and paper before touching the keyboard.

Problem difficulties can be out of order, so keep that in mind before focusing
down 3 hours on problem 1 and not getting anywhere. Do a good amount of thinking
on each problem before deciding which ones to focus on and which to put aside.

### Time allocation

It's the worst feeling in the world to sink a couple hours into a problem before
realizing that a different problem would've been easy pickings; we can easily
avoid this situation with proper time allocation. You have to use your own
judgement in deciding what is likely solvable and when you should quit.
Generally, don't spend "too long" on one problem, and stay away from problems
that look like they test something you don't know well.

### When you see a solution

If you immediately get the solution to a problem while reading it, it might be a
good idea to code it up quickly and get it out of the way.

It also might be a good idea to make some progress on other problems before
coding the one you know how to do. When you come back and start coding, you can
make sure your solution still makes sense and then you have ideas from the other
problems bouncing around in your head while you're coding.

### When there are partials

If you can get points from partially solving a problem (e.g. in USACO), then
it's a good idea to keep those subtasks in mind. There are two main approaches
to partially solving problems.

- Use most of your time to think about the full problem, then code the partials
  if you haven't found the solution and your time will soon run out.
  - If you find the full solution, be certain your solution is correct, lest you
    waste an hour coding something completely wrong.
  - Judge the difficulty of the partials carefully! It could take anywhere from
    30 seconds to 30 minutes to code a partial, or maybe a partial wasn't as
    trivial as you thought!
- Work up from the partials, coding the easiest and then going to the hardest.
  The partial subtasks may help you think of the full solution, and will also
  help you stay on track.

## Personal Commentaries

### Nathan Chen

At the Platinum level, I first read everything and then I usually spend the
first hour thinking about the easiest two problems (the hardest problem is
usually VERY hard). I continue thinking for the rest of the contest window and I
code them if I think I have the solution. I'm also the type to save partials for
last, when time is running out and I still have nothing.

### Benjamin Qi

Do the partials you can; hopefully by then you've figured out the full solution.
:D
