<Info title="Which text editor or IDE should I use?">

Depends on your personal preference. Try multiple and see which one you like
best.

</Info>

If you're just starting out, it's easier to begin by running code online and
worry about running locally later. You can find more information about running
code online [here](https://usaco.guide/general/running-code-online).

<PySection>

### Windows

Python comes with a program, known as **IDLE** (Integrated Development and
Learning Environment), that allows one to write and run Python code. It supports
many features, such as syntax highlighting and automatic indentation, that one
would normally expect from an IDE/text editor.

Alternatively, you can install editing software like VSCode.

### Linux

You can use built-in terminal editors, like ``vim`` and ``nano``. You can also
install editing software like VSCode. [For people who opened vim and can't exit]
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor)

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

## Using Command Line

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

You can run your C++ programs from the command line and use a text editor of
your choice.

### Text Editors

<Resources>
	<Resource title="Sublime Text 3" url="https://www.sublimetext.com/" starred>
		Fast, lightweight. Unlimited free evaluation period, though it will
		repeatedly ask you to purchase a license.
	</Resource>
	<Resource title="Vim" url="https://www.vim.org/">
		Classic text editor, usually preinstalled on Linux. Also see Neovim, MacVim.
	</Resource>
	<Resource title="Atom" url="https://atom.io/">
		From the makers of Github.
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Vim is probably the easiest way to print syntax-highlighted code on Mac, see the
response to
[this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1656914/printing-code-with-syntax-highlighting).

#### Sublime Text Notes (Ben)

I prefer Sublime Text because it opens instantly, it's simple to use, and it's
easy on the eyes. Also, it's not too hard to write your own
[custom commands](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24276143/can-i-create-my-own-command-in-sublime-and-how-to-associate-python-implementatio)
in Python.

- I prefer the _Mariana_ color scheme in place of the default.
  - From the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P), follow
    `UI: Select Color Scheme -> Mariana`
- [Package - Sublime Linter (GCC)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-gcc)

  - highlights compilation errors and warnings from `-Wall`
  - can use
    [`PackageResourceViewer`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PackageResourceViewer)
    to change linter settings. From the command palette, follow
    `PackageResourceViewer -> Open Resource -> SublimeLinter-gcc -> linter.py`.
    Now you can modify `linter.py` to compile with the same options that you
    normally use. For example, my `linter.py` looks like the following:

  ```py
  class GPlusPlus(Linter):
      name = "g++"
      cmd = "g++ ${args} -"
      regex = OUTPUT_RE
      multiline = True
      on_stderr = None

      defaults = {
          "selector": "source.c++",
          "args": ["-c", "-DLOCAL", "-std=c++17", "-O2", "-Wall", "-Wextra", "-Wshadow", "-Wconversion", "-Wfloat-equal", "-Wduplicated-cond", "-Wlogical-op"],
          "-I +": [],
          "-x": "c++",
          "-o": getGarbabgeFilePath(),
      }
  ```

Here's what linting looks like:

![sublime](running-code-img/sublime-ex.png)

Additional notes:

- I compile and run from the command line rather than building from within
  sublime text (i.e., I don't use Cmd-B).
- [`subl` symlink](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html)
  - Using `/usr/local/bin/subl` instead of `~/bin/subl` worked for me on OS X
    Mojave.
- [Package - Fast Olympic Coding](https://github.com/Jatana/FastOlympicCoding)
  (I don't use)
  - test manager can be useful
  - linting is covered by the above
  - stress testing is covered in
    [Debugging](/general/debugging-lang#stress-testing)
  - can't get debug to work

### Further Instructions

See [this module](/general/cpp-command) for information about installing,
compiling, and running C++ from the command line.

## Including `<bits/stdc++.h>`

You can use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` in place of separately including
libraries.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="1.1 - C++ Code Template" starred />
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		title="How does #include <bits/stdc++.h> work in C++?"
		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25311011/how-does-include-bits-stdc-h-work-in-c/25311052#25311052"
	/>
	<Resource source="GFG" title="GFG - <bits/stdc++.h>" url="bitsstdc-h-c" />
</Resources>

### Usage

This is usable with
[GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection). However, Mac OS X
uses [Clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) while Windows uses
[Microsoft Visual C++ (MVSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B)
by default. `<bits/stdc++.h>` is **not** a standard header file, so it will not
work with the latter two. This is one of the reasons why you should **not** use
`<bits/stdc++.h>` outside of competitive programming.

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		title="Why should I not #include <bits/stdc++.h>?"
		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31816095/why-should-i-not-include-bits-stdc-h"
		starred
	>
		wow, people are really mad about this!
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		title="#include <bits/stdc++.h> with visual studio does not compile"
		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25337300/include-bits-stdc-h-with-visual-studio-does-not-compile"
	 />
</Resources>

If you install GCC as described later in the module linked above, then you
should be good to go.

### Precompiling `<bits/stdc++.h>`

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="CF"
		title="Speed up GCC Compile Time"
		url="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53909"
	 />
</Resources>

Using this trick speeds up compilation time to less than a second!

**Make sure to compile `stdc++.h` with the flags that you normally use to compile your C++ program.**

#### Option 1 (Mentioned in CF blog)

```
mkdir bits
cp /usr/include/path_to/stdc++.h bits/
cd bits
g++ stdc++.h
```

To get the path of `stdc++.h`, compile your C++ file (with `stdc++.h` included) with `g++ file.cpp -H` and it should generate a list of included libraries. The path to `stdc++.h` should be second in the list. You can also directly copy the `stdc++.h` file [here](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/precompiled/stdc%2B%2B.h) into the `bits` directory instead of doing `cp /usr/include/path_to/stdc++.h bits/`.

Then, change `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` to `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`. Changing this tells the compiler to look for the local version.

#### Option 2

```
g++ /usr/include/path_to/bits/stdc++.h
```
Note that you might also need to add `sudo` before `g++` since you're directly modifying the global header.

To get the path of `stdc++.h`, compile your C++ file (with `stdc++.h` included) with `g++ file.cpp -H` and it should generate a list of included libraries. The path to `stdc++.h` should be second in the list.

Using this, you don't have to change `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` to `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`.

#### `-Winvalid-pch`

You may also want to add `-Winvalid-pch`; it gives you a warning if you used different flags.

For example, if I compiled `stdc++.h` with `-std=c++17`, but I compiled my C++ program with `-std=c++11` and included `-Winvalid-pch`, it shows:

```
b.cpp:1:25: warning: bits/stdc++.h.gch: not used because `__cpp_nontype_template_parameter_auto' not defined [-Winvalid-pch]
    1 | #include "bits/stdc++.h"
      |                         ^
```

## OS-Specific Recommendations

<IncompleteSection />

### Linux
	
Run this command to install C/C++ compilers on Linux:

`sudo apt install build-essential`
	
This will install compiling packages like `gcc`, `g++`, etc.

To compile a C++ file, run
	
`g++ file.cpp -O2 -Wall -o a.out`
	
* The `-O2` flag will turn on [these optimizations](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html) (read the `-O2` section).
	USACO uses this flag when compiling your program.
* The `-Wall` flag will show all warnings of the code, which can be helpful in debugging.
	
Then, you can run the executable with

`./a.out`

### Windows

With the variety of software available for Windows, deciding what to use can be
difficult. While the most popular options are Visual Studio Code, Geany, and
CodeBlocks, any text editor or IDE that you feel comfortable using (as long as
it works with C++) will work.

To get the full functionality of C++ on your Windows Machine, you should install
one of the following compilers, from easiest to most difficult to set up and
use:

#### Simple: [MinGW](http://mingw.org/) (Minimalist GNU for Windows)

If you want to keep the ease of use and simplicity of Linux C++, including the
ability to use commands like `g++` and easily include `<bits/stdc++.h>`, you can
install the compiler MinGW. This is a version of the `g++` compiler from Linux
available on Windows. If you are using VS Code, setting up MinGW can be more
difficult, but there are great guides to make the process easier.

	>
		Setting up MinGW with CLion
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Depending on the installer you used, installing MinGW could be a little
complicated.

**The Official Installer:**

1.  First, download and run the
    [MinGW installer](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/).
2.  Once it's installed, open the MinGW Installation Manager, click on Basic
    Setup on the left, and select `mingw32-gcc-g++-bin` for installation.
3.  Finally, Add it to your PATH following the latter half of
    [this tutorial](http://www.codebind.com/cprogramming/install-mingw-windows-10-gcc/)

**Microsoft's Mirror Installer:**

1.  First, [download the installer](https://tinyurl.com/mingw-usaco)
2.  When you run it, leave all settings at default except `Architecture`.
    1.  For `Architecture`, select `x86_64`.
3.  After you click next, copy the `Destination Folder Path` for later and
    finish the installation.
4.  Now, you need to add MinGW to your `Path`. To do that:
    1.  After the Installation has completed, search for
        `Environmental Variables` in the Windows Search Bar and click open
    2.  Click the button `Environment Variables` at the bottom left.
    3.  In the bottom half of the screen (under `System variables`), find the
        key `Path` and double click.
    4.  Click `New` on the top right and paste the path you copied. Add `\bin`
        to the end of it. It should look something like this:
        `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin`
    5.  You're Good to Go!

#### Moderate: Microsoft Compiler Toolset

Microsoft's Visual C++ Compiler is the official compiler for compiling programs
for Windows and can be installed either via installing the relevant packages
with Visual Studio 2019 or the build tools from their website. More information
on its installation can be found in their documentation.

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Microsoft"
		title="Microsoft Compiler Toolset Documentation"
		url="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160"
	>
		The Visual Studio Documentation
	</Resource>
</Resources>

In order to get a similar library to `<bits/stdc++.h>` you can use the following
template, which automatically swaps between `<bits/stdc++.h>` and Microsoft's
variant depending on the system running it:

```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
#include <__msvc_all_public_headers.hpp>
#endif
#ifdef __linux__
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#endif
using namespace std;
```

This checks if the compiler is compiling for windows (your local machine) or if
it is compiling for the remote judge and subsequently includes the correct
libraries for the system. This comes with the same consequences as using
`<bits/stdc++.h>` for the same reasons.

_Note: As USACO has now disallowed the use of templates during competitions, if
you want to be able to get the functionality of `<bits/stdc++.h>` on your local
machine, you should use MinGW instead._

#### Difficult: [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)

If you're already accustomed to the Linux Command line, this might be the best
option for you.

Windows Subsystem for Linux, commonly referred to as WSL, runs the linux kernel
(or an emulation layer, depending on which version you use) within you windows
installation. This allows you to use Linux binaries without needing to use Linux
as your main Operating System, meaning that you can install `g++`, use `g++`,
and consequently include `<bits/stdc++.h>` in your Competitive Programming C++
files.

Many people use WSL (such as Anthony), but it can be difficult to properly set
up.

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Microsoft"
		title="VSCode - GCC on WSL"
		url="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl"
	>
		difficult for beginners
	</Resource>
</Resources>

If you want to code in (neo)vim, you can install WSL and code through WSL bash.

To install the necessary tools after setting up WSL, you can run the following
commands.

On Debian based distributions like Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

On Arch based distributions like Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -Sy base-devel
```

You can find many tutorials on how to style up WSL and make it feel more cozy.
The first step is to use a proper terminal and not the default one that Windows
provides. An easy to use option is Windows Terminal, which can be found on the
[Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701).

### Mac

XCode?

#### Using `<bits/stdc++.h>` Without Installing GCC

If you installed Clang on Mac, then you can download `stdc++.h` from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tekfyl/bits-stdc-.h-for-mac/master/stdc%2B%2B.h)
and move it into a folder named `bits` that is located in the same directory as
where all other C++ header files are located. However, this is not recommended.

<JavaSection>

### Installation

#### Linux

First, you can check if you have Java already installed by running
`java --version` in the terminal. If it returns something like this:

```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

That means you have Java installed already. On the other hand, if you get
something like this:

```
Command 'java' not found
```

You will have to download and install JDK. On most Linux distros, the JDK can be
downloaded via the built in package manager.

##### Ubuntu/Debian

On Ubuntu, Debian, and other Ubuntu/Debian based distos, the JDK can be
installed via `apt`. You can install the Java JDK from the default repositories
by running: `sudo apt install default-jdk`.

After this finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should
get something like above.

##### Arch

On Arch and other Arch based distos (like Manjaro), the JDK can be installed via
`pacman`. You can install the Java JDK from the default repositories by running:
`sudo pacman -S jdk-openjdk`.

After this finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should
get something like above.

##### Fedora

On Fedora and other Red Hat based distos, the JDK can be installed via `dnf`.
You can install the Java JDK from the default repositories by running:
`sudo dnf install java-openjdk-devel.x86_64`.

After this finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should
get something like above.

#### Windows

First, can check if you already have Java installed by running `java --version`
in `cmd`. If it returns something like this:

```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1, mixed mode)
```

That means that you have Java installed already. On the other hand, if you get
something like this:

```
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

You will have to download and install JDK from
[here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.9.1%2B1/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.9.1_1.msi).

After it finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get
something like above. Note: the installer should automatically add Java into the
system `PATH`, but in the event that it doesn't, you can find more information
on how to do that
[here](https://www.poftut.com/how-to-set-java-jre-and-jdk-home-path-and-environment-variables-on-windows).

#### macOS

First, can check if you already have Java installed by running `java --version`
in the terminal. If it returns something like this:

```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1, mixed mode)
```

That means that you have Java installed already. On the other hand, if you get
something like this:

```
-bash: java: command not found
```

You will have to download and install JDK from
[here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.9.1%2B1/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_11.0.9.1_1.pkg).

After it finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get
something like above.

### Compiling and Running

Running a Java file off of the command-line is relatively simple after the JDK
is downloaded.

Consider this code of `Main.java` and assume it is in a file on your computer:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

Use the `cd` command on your console to get to the directory that contains
`Main.java`. Then, run the following command to compile the code:

```
javac Main.java
```

If it runs successfully, a file called `Main.class` will show up in the same
directory, which can be executed with the next command:

```
java Main
```

If everything goes accordingly, the console should output `Hello World!`.

If you do USACO-style file I/O, meaning that files are in the "local directory",
then the files must be located in the same directory as the source code (if you
use the above method). You can find a Java testing script for USACO
[here](https://usaco.guide/general/debugging-lang#stress-testing).

<PySection>

### Installation

#### Windows and Mac

Download Python through [the official website](https://python.org).

#### Linux

If you have `apt` (the package manager), you can install Python 3 with

`sudo apt install python3.8`

You can also [build from source and install](https://github.com/python/cpython#build-instructions).

Make sure that you are using the correct version of Python. Python 2 is quite
different from Python 3 (but parts of the version number beyond 2. or 3. do not
matter much). We generally recommend newcomers to use Python 3, but if you are
used to programming in Python 2, that is OK too.

**The Python version can matter when using the command line to run Python;**
sometimes, `python3` must be used instead of `python` in order to run Python 3.
Try both commands, and pay attention to the version that Python prints to
determine if this is the case on your system. For example:

```
python --version   # prints Python 2.7.13
python3 --version  # prints Python 3.8.1
```
