<Info title="Which text editor or IDE should I use?">

Depends on your personal preference. Try multiple and see which one you like best.

</Info>

If you're just starting out, it's easier to begin by running code online and worry about running locally later. You can find more information about running code online [here](https://usaco.guide/general/running-code-online).

<PySection>

Python comes with a program, known as **IDLE** (Integrated Development and Learning Environment), that allows one to write and run Python code. It supports many features, such as syntax highlighting and automatic indentation, that one would normally expect from an IDE/text editor. However, feel free to use another editor or IDE if you want to.

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>


## Using Command Line

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

You can run your C++ programs from the command line and use a text editor of your choice.

### Text Editors

<Resources>
	<Resource title="Sublime Text 3" url="https://www.sublimetext.com/" starred>
		Fast, lightweight. Unlimited free evaluation period, though it will
		repeatedly ask you to purchase a license.
	</Resource>
	<Resource title="Vim" url="https://www.vim.org/">
		Classic text editor, usually preinstalled on Linux. Also see Neovim, MacVim
	</Resource>
	<Resource title="Atom" url="https://atom.io/">
		From the makers of Github.
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Vim is probably the easiest way to print syntax-highlighted code on Mac, see the response to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1656914/printing-code-with-syntax-highlighting).

#### Sublime Text Notes (Ben)

- I prefer the **Mariana** color scheme in place of the default.
  - open command palette (Cmd-Shift-P) -> change color scheme
- [`subl` symlink](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html)
  - Using `/usr/local/bin/subl` instead of `~/bin/subl` worked for me on OS X Mojave.
- [Package - Sublime Linter (GCC)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-gcc)
  - highlights compilation errors and warnings from `-Wall`
  - can change compilation commands in `linter.py`
- [Package - Fast Olympic Coding](https://github.com/Jatana/FastOlympicCoding) (I don't use)
  - test manager can be useful
  - linting is covered by the above
  - stress testing is covered in [Debugging](/general/debugging-lang#stress-testing)
  - can't get debug to work

<!--    - [Editing Build Settings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23789410/how-to-edit-sublime-text-build-settings)
    - no need to do this if you just use command line to compile & run -->

### Further Instructions

See [this module](/general/cpp-command) for information about installing, compiling, and running C++ from the command line.

## Including `<bits/stdc++.h>`

You can use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` in place of separately including libraries.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="1.1 - C++ Code Template" starred></Resource>
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		title="How does #include <bits/stdc++.h> work in C++?"

	</Resource>
</Resources>

### Usage

This is usable with [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection). However, Mac OS X uses [Clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) while Windows uses [Microsoft Visual C++ (MVSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B) by default. `<bits/stdc++.h>` is **not** a standard header file, so it will not work with the latter two. This is one of the reasons why you should **not** use `<bits/stdc++.h>` outside of competitive programming.

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="SO"
		title="Why should I not #include <bits/stdc++.h>?"
		url="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31816095/why-should-i-not-include-bits-stdc-h"

	></Resource>
</Resources>

If you install GCC as described later in the module linked above, then you should be good to go.

## OS-Specific Recommendations

<IncompleteSection />

### Linux

### Windows

Geany or CodeBlocks?

### Mac

XCode?

#### Using `<bits/stdc++.h>` Without Installing GCC

If you installed Clang on Mac, then you can download `stdc++.h` from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tekfyl/bits-stdc-.h-for-mac/master/stdc%2B%2B.h) and move it into a folder named `bits` that is located in the same directory as where all other C++ header files are located. However, this is not recommended.

<JavaSection>

### Installation

#### Linux

First, you can check if you have Java already installed by running `java --version` in the terminal. If it returns something like this:
```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```
That means you have Java installed already. On the other hand, if you get something like this:
```
Command 'java' not found
```
You will have to download and install JDK. On most Linux distros, the JDK can be downloaded via the built in package manager.

##### Ubuntu/Debian

On Ubuntu, Debian, and other Ubuntu/Debian based distos, the JDK can be installed via `apt`. You can install the Java JDK from the default repositories by running: `sudo apt install default-jdk`.

After this finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get something like above.

##### Arch

On Arch and other Arch based distos (like Manjaro), the JDK can be installed via `pacman`. You can install the Java JDK from the default repositories by running: `sudo pacman -S jdk-openjdk`.

After this finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get something like above.

##### Fedora

On Fedora and other Red Hat based distos, the JDK can be installed via `dnf`. You can install the Java JDK from the default repositories by running: `sudo dnf install java-openjdk-devel.x86_64`.

After this finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get something like above.

#### Windows

First, can check if you already have Java installed by running `java --version` in `cmd`. If it returns something like this:
```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1, mixed mode)
```
That means that you have Java installed already. On the other hand, if you get something like this:
```
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
You will have to download and install JDK from [here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.9.1%2B1/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.9.1_1.msi).

After it finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get something like above. Note: the installer should automatically add Java into the system `PATH`, but in the event that it doesn't, you can find more information on how to do that [here](https://www.poftut.com/how-to-set-java-jre-and-jdk-home-path-and-environment-variables-on-windows).

#### macOS

First, can check if you already have Java installed by running `java --version` in the terminal. If it returns something like this:
```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1, mixed mode)
```
That means that you have Java installed already. On the other hand, if you get something like this:
```
-bash: java: command not found
```
You will have to download and install JDK from [here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.9.1%2B1/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_11.0.9.1_1.pkg).

After it finishes installing, if you run `java --version` again, you should get something like above.

### Compiling and Running

Running a Java file off of the command-line is relatively simple after the JDK is downloaded.

Consider this code of `Main.java` and assume it is in a file on your computer:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

Use the `cd` command on your console to get to the directory that contains `Main.java`. Then, run the following command to compile the code:

```
javac Main.java
```

If it runs successfully, a file called `Main.class` will show up in the same directory, which can be executed with the next command:

```
java Main
```

If everything goes accordingly, the console should output `Hello World!`.

If you do USACO-style file I/O, meaning that files are in the "local directory", then the files must be located in the same directory as the source code (if you use the above method). You can find a Java testing script for USACO [here](https://usaco.guide/general/debugging-lang#stress-testing).

<PySection>

Download Python through [the official website](https://python.org). On Windows and Mac, you can download executable files directly; on Linux, you must either download the Python source code and compile from source, or obtain Python through your package manager.

Make sure that you are using the correct version of Python. Python 2 is quite different from Python 3 (but parts of the version number beyond 2. or 3. do not matter much). We generally recommend newcomers to use Python 3, but if you are used to programming in Python 2, that is OK too.

**The Python version can matter when using the command line to run Python;** sometimes, `python3` must be used instead of `python` in order to run Python 3. Try both commands, and pay attention to the version that Python prints to determine if this is the case on your system. For example, running the following in Terminal on my computer produces:

```
python --version # prints Python 2.7.13
python3 --version # prints Python 3.8.1
```
