prerequisites:
  - modules
---

We're using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a superset of Markdown, using the
[XDM compiler](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm). HTML and React components are
supported, so it is possible to add interactivity / custom components to each
module.

## Frontmatter

[Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is the stuff in the
beginning of each module that's surrounded by three dashes. Frontmatter is
written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/). It stores the "metadata" for each module.

- **ID**: _Required_. The ID of the module. Ex: `getting-started`, or
  `containers`. This ID is used to identify the module, so make sure it is
  **unique** and **all lowercase with dashes only**. The URL will be generated
  based off this.
- **Title**: _Required_. The title of the module. Ex: `Getting Started`
- **Author**: _Required_. The author of the module. Ex: `Unknown`
- **Contributors**: _Optional_. The people who contributed code and/or short
  explanations to the module.
- **Description**: _Required_. A short description of the module, similar to
  what [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) has
  in their syllabus. Markdown/LaTeX does not work in the description field.
- **Prerequisites**: _Optional_. Any prerequisites for this module. If you want
  to reference a module as a prerequisite, list it as a module ID. A link will
  be auto-generated.
- **Frequency**: _Optional_. Takes a number 0-4 inclusive, where 0 = never shown
  up before and 4 = shows up \~once a contest. Leave this field out if you don't
  want to show the frequency.
- **Redirects**: _Optional_. Takes a list of URLs that will redirect to the
  current module. Add a redirect whenever you change the module ID or move the
  module to a different division.

### Example Frontmatter

### Module Ordering

Located at `content/ordering.ts`, this file stores the ordering of the modules.
The format should be self-explanatory (it matches based on the ID).

## Linking to Modules

Linking to another module within the guide looks like this:

`[insert text here](/general/practicing)`.

[insert text here](/general/practicing)

Don't use relative links like `practicing`, as that will break our
[link checker](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/docs/Front%20End%20Documentation.md).

## Table of Contents

A table of contents will be auto-generated based off of the headings in the
Markdown. Keep this in mind when formatting your module.

## MDX and Custom Components

<Optional title="XDM and MDX">
We use the [XDM compiler](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm), which has a few differences from MDX v1:

- Markdown interleaved in JSX is fully supported; ie. this works as expected:
  `<Info>some **markdown**</Info>`
- As an extension of (1), indentation is fully supported. You can indent the
  markdown nested in JSX tags. This also means that indenting text with four
  spaces doesn't make it a code block; explicitly wrap the code block with three
  backticks instead.
- `<` and `>` need to be escaped with backslashes; ie. `\<`

Note that JSX comments (`{/* ... */}`) don't work well with Prettier, so use
[HTML comments](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp) instead.
Internally we map HTML comments to JSX comments before passing the markdown to
XDM. Don't worry if you don't understand all of this yet.

</Optional>

Some components are globally available in every module (without having to be
imported):

- `<Spoiler>`
- `<Info>`
- `<Warning>`
- `<Optional>`
- `<Problems>`
- `<FocusProblem>`
- `<Resources>`
- `<Resource>`
- `<TextTooltip>`
- `<LanguageSection>`
- `<CPPSection>`
- `<JavaSection>`
- `<PySection>`
- `<IncompleteSection>`
- `<Asterisk>`
- `<Quiz>`

These are all documented below.

### Spoilers

Spoilers are collapsible elements that only show themselves when the user clicks
on it. It's useful when writing solutions to problems.

```
<Spoiler title="Show Solution">
- Insert solution here
</Spoiler>
```

<Spoiler title="Show Solution">
- Insert solution here
</Spoiler>

### Info Block

```
<Info title="Insert Title Here">
**Markdown is Supported!!**
</Info>
```

<Info title="Insert Title Here">
**Markdown is Supported!!**
</Info>

### Warning Block

```
<Warning title="Insert Title Here">
Fun fact: the title attribute is optional.
</Warning>
```

<Warning title="Insert Title Here">

</Warning>

### Optional Content

```
<Optional title="Insert Title Here">

```

<Optional title="Insert Title Here">

### Problem Lists

Each module has two corresponding files, a `.mdx` file and a `.problems.json`
file. The `.problems.json` file stores the focus problems and problem lists used
in that module; it is also indexed by Algolia for problem search.

The `.problems.json` file holds an object, where keys are problem list names (or
focus problem names) and values are arrays of `ProblemMetadata` objects. For
focus problems, the array should have length exactly one. Additionally, the
`.problems.json` file should have a `MODULE_ID` key with value equal to a string
that represents the module ID.

For more information on problem definitions, refer to `src/models/problem.ts`.

Example usage:

```
<Problems problems="problems" />
```

`[module].problems.json` should have a key of `problems` that maps to an array
of `ProblemMetadata`.

There is a distinction between `ProblemInfo` and `ProblemMetadata`.
`ProblemMetadata` is what is stored in `[module].problems.json`. Gatsby takes
`ProblemMetadata` and converts it into `ProblemInfo` at build time; React
components use `ProblemInfo` when interacting with problem information. The
documentation below is for `ProblemMetadata`, which is what content authors will
be writing.

`ProblemMetadata` fields:

`uniqueId` -- The uniqueId of the problem. Problem progress is linked to this,
so don't change this (otherwise problem progress will be lost). By convention,
it's `[source]-[SlugifiedProblemNameCamelCased]`.

- If the problem name is only one word, the word is lower cased.
- If the problem is USACO or CSES, the unique ID is instead
  `usaco-[USACO URL Number]` or `cses-[CSES number]`.
- If the problem is Codeforces, the unique ID is
  `cf-[contestNumber][problemLetter]`. If it's CF Gym, it's
  `cfgym-[gymNumber][problemLetter]`.
- If the problem is an OI with a year, the unique ID is
  `[oiName]-[twodigityear]-[slugifiedName]`.

Here are some example unique ID's:

```
cses-2177
poi-08-blockade
apio-18-duathlon
dmoj-investment
infoarena-xortransform
usaco-949
cses-1691
kattis-chineseremainder
cfgym-102538F
cf-1209H
spoj-LexicographicalStringSearch
ys-AssociativeArray
```

Problems with the same unique ID are expected to have identical names, sources,
and URL's.

`name` -- The name of the problem. Should not include source.

Examples:

```
2009 - Beetle
Greedy Pie Eaters
Zuma
2014 - The Stables of Genghis Khan
```

`source` -- The source of the problem. Restricted to: _todo, refer to
`src/models/problem.ts` `contests` and `probSources`_

`difficulty` -- The difficulty of the problem **relative to the module it is
in**. Valid options are `Very Easy`, `Easy`, `Normal`, `Hard`, `Very Hard`,
`Insane`

`isStarred` -- Whether this problem should be starred or not.

`tags` -- List of tags for this problem.

`solutionMetadata` -- Information about the solution.

```
export type ProblemMetadata = Omit<ProblemInfo, 'solution'> & {
  solutionMetadata:
    | {
        // auto generate problem solution label based off of the given site
        // For sites like CodeForces: "Check contest materials, located to the right of the problem statement."
        kind: 'autogen-label-from-site';
        // The site to generate it from. Sometimes this may differ from the source; for example, Codeforces could be the site while Baltic OI could be the source if Codeforces was hosting a Baltic OI problem.
        site: string;
      }
    | {
        // internal solution
        kind: 'internal';
      }
    | {
        // URL solution
        // Use this for links to PDF solutions, etc
        kind: 'link';
        url: string;
      }
    | {
        // Competitive Programming Handbook
        // Ex: 5.3 or something
        kind: 'CPH';
        section: string;
      }
    | {
        // USACO solution, generates it based off of the USACO problem ID
        // ex. 1113 is mapped to sol_prob1_gold_feb21.html
        kind: 'USACO';
        usacoId: string;
      }
    | {
        // IOI solution, generates it based off of the year
        // ex. Maps year = 2001 to https://ioinformatics.org/page/ioi-2001/27
        kind: 'IOI';
        year: number;
      }
    | {
        // no solution exists
        kind: 'none';
      }
    | {
        // for focus problems, when the solution is presented in the module of the problem
        kind: 'in-module';
        moduleId: string;
      }
    | {
        kind: 'sketch';
        sketch: string;
      };
};
```

Editorials are also written in MDX. The frontmatter has four fields:

```
---
id: cses-1621
source: CSES
title: Distinct Numbers
author: Nathan Wang
---

... solution
```

The ID of the solution frontmatter must be the same as the unique ID of the
problem. Make sure to also update the `kind` of the `solutionMetadata` to
`'internal'` for any associated problems. We assume that if there is an internal
solution, we should use it; therefore, the build will throw an error if there is
an internal solution but the `solutionMetadata`'s `kind` isn't set to

`'internal'`. The [Adding Solutions module](/general/adding-solution) describes
how to add a new solution.

### Focus Problem

Displays a singular problem as a "focus problem."

```
<FocusProblem problem="genPermutations" />
```

`[module].problems.json` should have a key of `genPermutations` that maps to an
**array** of length 1.

### Resource Lists

```
<Resources>
  <Resource
    source="Errichto"
    title="Video - How to test your solution"
    url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM"
    starred
  >
    using a script to stress test
  </Resource>
  ...
</Resources>
```

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Errichto"
		title="Video - How to test your solution"
		url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM"
		starred
	>
		using a script to stress test
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Special functionality based on source:

- If the source is a book, it'll automatically set the URL to point to the book.
  - Supported books:
    - `GCP` (Guide to Competitive Programming)
    - `CPH` (Competitive Programming Handbook)
    - `PAPS` (Principles of Algorithmic Problem Solving)
    - `CP2` (Competitive Programming 2)
    - `IUSACO` (Darren's book; will auto-set URL based on user language; uses
      C++ for Python users)
- Some sources will automatically have tooltips generated for them (listed
  [here](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/947a3ac220e330fa03aa5b53a201f80b0f4c208f/src/models/problem.ts#L22)).

### Tooltips

There are two main types of tooltips: text tooltips, which display a dotted
underline under the text, and asterisk tooltips, which render an asterisk that
can be hovered over.

#### `<TextTooltip>`

```
<TextTooltip content="Popup text goes here">short text goes here</TextTooltip>
```

<TextTooltip content="Popup text goes here">short text goes here</TextTooltip>

#### `<Asterisk>`

```
<Asterisk>Popup text goes here</Asterisk>
```

<Asterisk>Popup text goes here</Asterisk>

### Incomplete Section

```
<IncompleteSection>

- this list is optional and can be used to specify what is missing
- missing 32-bit integer explanation

</IncompleteSection>
```

<IncompleteSection>

- missing 32-bit integer explanation

</IncompleteSection>

### Code Blocks and Code Snippets

Code blocks are separated by three backticks, just like in normal markdown.
Additionally, we have support for collapsible code snippets. An example for how
to use them can be found below:

**With title**

```
Before
//BeginCodeSnip{Optional Code Snippet Title}
Code snippet goes here
You can indent the entire BeginCodeSnip block (including the BeginCodeSnip line) and it will function as expected
//EndCodeSnip
After
```

```cpp
Before
//BeginCodeSnip{Optional Code Snippet Title}
Code snippet goes here
You can indent the entire BeginCodeSnip block (including the BeginCodeSnip line) and it will function as expected
//EndCodeSnip
After
```

**Without title:**

```
//BeginCodeSnip{}
Code snippet goes here
//EndCodeSnip

Other code goes here
```

```cpp
//BeginCodeSnip{}
My snippet code goes here
//EndCodeSnip

My non-snippet code goes here
```

Some common snippets have shorthand notations, as defined in
[`src/mdx-plugins/rehype-snippets.js`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/src/mdx-plugins/rehype-snippets.js).
They can be accessed using `CodeSnip{Snip ID}`.

#### Kattio

`CodeSnip{Kattio}` gets replaced with an indented version (based off of
indentation of `CodeSnip`):

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class myClass {
	CodeSnip{Kattio}
	public static void main ...
}
```

#### C++ Long Template

`CodeSnip{Benq Template}` gets replaced with
[Benq's Long Template](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/contest/TemplateLong.cpp).

```cpp
CodeSnip{Benq Template}
```

#### C++ Short Template

`CodeSnip{CPP Short Template}` is replaced with

```cpp
CodeSnip{CPP Short Template}
```

### Language-Specific Content
