## Programming Competitions

A
[programming competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)
generally lasts for several hours and consists of a set of problems. These
problems are not open problems; they have already been solved by the problem
writers and testers and are designed to be solved in the short timeframe of a
contest. In general, each problem in competitive programming is solved with a
two-step process:

1.  coming up with the algorithm, which involves problem solving skills and
    intuition
2.  implementing the algorithm, which requires programming skills to translate
    the algorithm into working code.

For each problem, you submit the completed code to a grader, which checks the
answers calculated by your program against a set of predetermined test cases.
For each problem, you are given a time limit (usually 2 seconds) and a memory
limit (usually 256 [megabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte)) that
your program must satisfy.

For those of you with experience in software development, note that competitive
programming is quite different, as the goal is to write programs that compute
the correct answer, run quickly, and can be implemented quickly. Note that
nowhere was maintainability of code mentioned. You don't need to bother
documenting your code because it only needs to be readable to you during the
contest. That being said, you probably want to maintain a bare minimum level of
readability so you can keep track of what's going on.

Here is a task similar to the one that was solved in Kamil's video:

<FocusProblem problem="general" />

<Spoiler title="Solution">

Just print the second-to-last character of the input.

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	string s; cin >> s;
	cout << s[s.size()-2];
}
```

</CPPSection>

<PySection>

```py
print(input()[-2])
```

</PySection>

<JavaSection>

```java
// with Kattio from https://usaco.guide/general/input-output#java

public class A {
	static Kattio io = new Kattio();
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String s = io.next();
		System.out.println(s.charAt(s.length()-2));
		io.close(); // make sure to include this line -- closes io and flushes the output
	}
}
```

## USACO

The _USA Computing Olympiad_ is a national programming competition that occurs
four times a year, with December, January, February, and US Open (March)
contests. The regular contests are four hours long, and the US Open is five
hours long. Each contest contains three problems. Solutions are evaluated and
scored against a set of predetermined test cases that are not visible to the
student. Scoring is out of 1000 points, with each problem being weighted equally
(\~333 points). There are four divisions of contests: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and
Platinum. After each contest, students who meet the contest-dependent cutoff for
promotion will compete in the next division for future contests.

See the [USACO FAQ](/usaco-faq/) for more information.
