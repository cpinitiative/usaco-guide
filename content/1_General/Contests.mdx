  - Beginner / Regular Contests: 4 or 6 problems, ~100 min
  - Grand Contests: 6 problems, 110 - 150 min
- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/problemset)
  - Div 1-4: 5-6 problems (with some variations), 2 to 2.5 hrs
- [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/my-dashboard/)
  - Div 2, Div 1
  - 75 min coding, 15 min challenge
  - Solutions only tested after contest!
