Both Java and C++ contain two versions of sets and maps; one using **sorting**
and the other using **hashing**. We'll only introduce the former version in this
module.

## Sets

<FocusProblem problem="dis" />

A **set** is a collection of objects that contains no duplicates. In ordered
sets, the entries are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions, and
searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements in
the set.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

The operations on a C++ [`set`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/)
include:

- `insert`, which adds an element to the set if not already present.
- `erase`, which deletes an element if it exists.
- `count`, which returns `1` if the set contains the element and `0` if it
  doesn't.

```cpp
set<int> s;
s.insert(1); // [1]
s.insert(4); // [1, 4]
s.insert(2); // [1, 2, 4]
	
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
cout << s.count(1) << endl; // 1
s.erase(1); // [2, 4]
cout << s.count(5) << endl; // 0
s.erase(0); // [2, 4]
// if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens

for (int element : s) {
	cout << element << " ";
}
cout << endl;
// You can iterate through an set in sorted order
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

The operations on a `TreeSet` are `add`, which adds an element to the set if not
already present, `remove`, which deletes an element if it exists, and
`contains`, which checks whether the set contains that element.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
set.add(1); // [1]
set.add(4); // [1, 4]
set.add(2); // [1, 2, 4]
set.add(1); // [1, 2, 4]
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
System.out.println(set.contains(1)); // true
set.remove(1); // [2, 4]
System.out.println(set.contains(5)); // false
set.remove(0); // [2, 4]
// if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens

for (int element : set) {
	System.out.println(element);
}
// You can iterate through an set in sorted order
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

<Warning>

Ordered sets and maps are **not** built into Python. The Python
[OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict)
stores keys in the same order as they were inserted in, **not** in sorted order.

</Warning>

The built in python unsorted set supports:

- `add()`: Adds element to set
- `remove()`: Removes element from set
- `x in set`: Checks if element x is in the set

```py
set = set()
set.add(1) # {1}
set.add(4) # {1, 4}
set.add(2) # {1, 4, 2}
set.add(1) # {1, 4, 2}
# the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
print(1 in set) # True
set.remove(1) # {4, 2}
print(5 in set) # False
set.remove(0) # {4, 2}
# if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

Additional functions that sets support are discussed in the
[Silver module](/silver/intro-ordered).

### Solution - Distinct Numbers

This problem asks us to calculate the number of distinct values in a given list.

#### Method 1 - Set

This is probably the easier of the two methods, but requires knowledge of sets.
Because sets only store one copy of each value, we can insert all the numbers
into a set, and then print out the size of the set.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {

	int n;
	cin >> n;

	set<int> distinctNumbers;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int number; cin >> number;
		distinctNumbers.insert(number);
	}

	cout << distinctNumbers.size() << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
// Source: Daniel

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class DistinctNumbers {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();
		int n = io.nextInt();
		Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			set.add(io.nextInt());
		}
		io.println(set.size());
		io.close();
	}

	CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
n = int(input()) # unused
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
distinct_nums = set(nums)
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

We can do this more efficiently by skipping the creation of the list, and use a
set comprehension directly:

```py
n = int(input()) # unused
distinct_nums = {int(x) for x in input().split()}
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

#### Method 2 - Sorting

Check out the [sorting solution](/solutions/cses-1621).

## Maps

<FocusProblem problem="ex" />

A **map** is a set of ordered pairs, each containing a **key** and a **value**.
In a map, all keys are required to be unique, but values can be repeated. Maps
have three primary methods:

- one to add a specified key-value pairing
- one to retrieve the value for a given key
- one to remove a key-value pairing from the map

Insertions, deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is
the number of elements in the map.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In a C++ [`map`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/) `m`:

- the `m[key] = value` operator assigns a value to a key and places the key and
  value pair into the map. The operator `m[key]` returns the value associated
  with the key. If the key is not present in the map, then `m[key]` is set to 0.
- The `count(key)` method returns the number of times the key is in the map
  (which is either one or zero), and therefore checks whether a key exists in
  the map.
- Lastly, `erase(key)` removes the map entry associated with the specified key.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
m[1] = 5; // [(1, 5)]
m[3] = 14; // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
m[2] = 7; // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m[0] = -1; // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m.erase(2); // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (3, 14)]
cout << m[1] << '\n'; // 5
cout << m.count(7) << '\n' ; // 0
cout << m.count(1) << '\n' ; // 1
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In a `TreeMap`, the `put(key, value)` method assigns a value to a key and places
the key and value pair into the map. The `get(key)` method returns the value
associated with the key. The `containsKey(key)` method checks whether a key
exists in the map. Lastly, `remove(key)` removes the map entry associated with
the specified key. All of these operations are $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but again, due
to the hashing, this has a high constant factor.

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();
map.put(1, 5); // [(1, 5)]
map.put(3, 14); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
map.put(2, 7); // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
map.remove(2); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
System.out.println(map.get(1)); // 5
System.out.println(map.containsKey(7)); // false
System.out.println(map.containsKey(1)); // true
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Colloquially, maps are referred to as **dicts** in python. They act as hash
maps, so they actually have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ insertion, deletion, and searches.

```py
d = {}
d[1] = 5 # {1: 5}
d[3] = 14 # {1: 5, 3: 14}
d[2] = 7 # {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 14}
del d[2] # {1: 5, 3: 14}
print(d[1]) # 5
print(7 in d) # False
print(1 in d) # True
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

### Iterating Over Maps

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

To iterate over maps, you can use a `for` loop.

```cpp
for (pair<int,int> x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << '\n';
}
for (auto x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << '\n';
}

/* both output the following:
0 -1
1 5
3 14
*/
```

The map stores pairs in the form `{key, value}`. The `auto` keyword suffices to
iterate over any type of pair. You can use these pairs normally, as introduced
in [this module](/bronze/intro-ds#pairs--tuples).

Additionally, you can pass by reference when iterating over a map, like this:

```cpp
for (auto& x : m) {
	x.second = 3;
}
for (pair<int,int> x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << '\n';
}

/*
0 3
1 3
3 3
*/
```

This allows you to modify the values of the pairs stored in the map.

<!-- When passing by value (the first example), you can only access the `{key, value}` pairs. When you pass by reference (the second example),  --> <!-- you iterate through will change the values stored in the map. -->

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

To iterate over maps, you can use a `for` loop over the keys.

```java
for (int k : m.keySet()) {
	System.out.println(k + " " + m.get(k));
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

To iterate over `dict`s, there are three options. Dicts will be returned in the
same order of insertion in
[Python 3.6+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/are-dictionaries-ordered-in-python-3-6).
You can iterate over the keys:

```py
for key in d:
	print(key)
```

You can iterate over the values:

```py
for value in d.values():
	print(value)
```

You can iterate over the key-value pairs:

```py
for key, value in d.items():
	print(key, value)
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

### Inserting / Deleting Keys While Iterating

While you are free to change the _values_ in a map when iterating over it (as
demonstrated above), be careful about inserting and deleting keys while
iterating.

<LanguageSection>

<PySection>

This code will give a runtime error (although similar code _will_ create a `map`
with 11 entries in C++):

```py
def iterate_insert():
	d = {0:0}

	for key in d:
		if key == 10:
			break
		d[key] = 5
		d[key+1] = 0

	print("ENTRIES:")
	for key,value in d.items():
		print(key,value)

iterate_insert()
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 17, in <module>
    iterate_insert()
  File "test.py", line 7, in iterate_insert
    for key in d:
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

If you want to remove every third entry from a map, one way is to just create a
new map.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}
d_new = dict(item for i, item in enumerate(d.items()) if i % 3 != 2)

print("new dict:", d_new)
# new dict: {0: 0, 1: 1, 3: 3, 4: 4, 6: 6, 7: 7, 9: 9}
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to delete and remove them
after the iteration finishes:

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}
to_remove = {key for i, key in enumerate(d) if i % 3 == 2}

for key in to_remove:
	del d[key]
print("new dict:", d)
# new dict: {0: 0, 1: 1, 3: 3, 4: 4, 6: 6, 7: 7, 9: 9}
```

</PySection>

<CPPSection>

This code will work (adding keys while iterating over a map):

```cpp
void iterate_insert() {
	map<int,int> m; m[0] = 0; //starts with a single key
	for (auto& p: m) { //adds keys in the loop until the key 10
		if (p.f == 10) break;
		p.s = 5;
		m[p.f+1] = 0;
	}
	cout << "ENTRIES:\n";
	for (pair<int,int> p: m)
		cout << p.f << " " << p.s << "\n";
}

/*
ENTRIES:
0 5
1 5
2 5
3 5
4 5
5 5
6 5
7 5
8 5
9 5
10 0
*/
```

However, consider the following code, which attempts to remove every third entry
from a map.

```cpp
void iterate_remove_bad() {
	map<int,int> m; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) m[i] = i;
	int cnt = 0;
	for (auto it = begin(m); it != end(m); ++it) {
		cout << "CURRENT KEY: " << it->f << "\n";
		cnt ++;
		if (cnt%3 == 0) m.erase(it);
	}
	cout << "REMAINING ENTRIES:\n";
	for (pair<int,int> p: m)
		cout << p.f << " " << p.s << "\n";
}

/*
CURRENT KEY: 0
CURRENT KEY: 1
CURRENT KEY: 2
CURRENT KEY: 1
CURRENT KEY: 3
CURRENT KEY: 4
CURRENT KEY: 3
CURRENT KEY: 5
CURRENT KEY: 6
CURRENT KEY: 7
CURRENT KEY: 8
CURRENT KEY: 9
CURRENT KEY: 8
REMAINING ENTRIES:
0 0
1 1
3 3
5 5
7 7
8 8
*/
```

However, we would expect the keys 2, 5, and 8 to be removed from the map, but
this is not the case. 2 is correctly removed, but the next key removed is 4, not
5! And it seems that some keys are appearing more than once during the
iteration.

As the documentation for
[`erase`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/erase/) mentions,
"iterators, pointers and references referring to elements removed by the
function are invalidated." So incrementing `it` after `it` has been erased from
the map might not produce the intended result. If you're lucky, this will
produce a segmentation fault. Unfortunately, sometimes (as in this case) the
code will run without appearing to produce an error.

If we compile using
[`-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG`](/general/debugging-lang/#-d_glibcxx_debug) and run the
above, then

```
g++ -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG whoops.cpp -o whoops && ./whoops
```

gives an error, as expected.

```

```

Similarly, in
[Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html),

> If the map is modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
> (except through the iterator's own remove operation), the results of the
> iteration are undefined.

As suggested by
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8234779/how-to-remove-from-a-map-while-iterating-it/39719450#39719450)
StackOverflow post, the following code produces the intended results.

```cpp
void iterate_remove_ok() {
	map<int,int> m; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) m[i] = i;
	int cnt = 0;
	for (auto it = begin(m), next_it = it; it != end(m); it = next_it) {
		++next_it;
		cout << "CURRENT KEY: " << it->f << "\n";
		++cnt;
		if (cnt%3 == 0) {
			m.erase(it);
		}
	}
	cout << "REMAINING ENTRIES:\n";
	for (pair<int,int> p: m)
		cout << p.f << " " << p.s << "\n";
}

/*
CURRENT KEY: 0

CURRENT KEY: 2
CURRENT KEY: 3

CURRENT KEY: 9
REMAINING ENTRIES:
0 0
1 1
3 3
4 4
6 6

*/
```

You could also just create a new map instead of removing from the old one.

```cpp
void iterate_remove_ok_2() {
	map<int,int> m, M; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) m[i] = i;
	int cnt = 0;
	for (pair<int,int> p: m) {
		++cnt;
		if (cnt%3 != 0) M[p.f] = p.s;
	}
	swap(m,M);
	cout << "REMAINING ENTRIES:\n";
	for (pair<int,int> p: m)
		cout << p.f << " " << p.s << "\n";
}

/*
REMAINING ENTRIES:
0 0
1 1
3 3
4 4
6 6
7 7
9 9
*/
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Modifying a Collection (`Set`, `Map`, etc.) in the middle of a for-each loop is
unlikely to work, as it will probably cause a
[ConcurrentModificationException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html).
See the following snippet for an example:

```java
void iterateRemoveBad() {
	Set<Integer> s = new TreeSet<>();
	// s starts as {0, 1, 2}
	s.add(0); s.add(1); s.add(2);
	for (Integer a : s) {
		s.remove(a); // ConcurrentModificationException thrown!!
	}
}
```

One work-around is to use `Iterator` and the `.remove()` method to remove
elements while looping over them, like in the next code snippet:

```java
void iterateRemoveSet() {
	Set<Integer> s = new TreeSet<>();
	// s starts as {0, 1, 2}
	s.add(0); s.add(1); s.add(2);

	Iterator<Integer> iter = s.iterator();
	while (iter.hasNext()) {
		int key = iter.next();
		if (key == 0 || key == 2) {
			iter.remove();
		}
	}

	// s ends as {1}
	System.out.println("ENTRIES:");
	for (Integer a : s) {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
}

/*
ENTRIES:
1
*/
```

However, `Iterator` is not commonly seen in Java, so the best option (in most
cases) if you want to remove/insert mutiple elements at once is to use your
Container's `.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` methods. That means that you should
put all the elements you want to remove (or add) in a new Collection, and then
use that new Collection as the parameter of the `.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)`
method that you call on your original Collection. See the following code snippet
for an example (it works equivalently to the code above):

```java
void iterateRemoveSetGood() {
	Set<Integer> s = new TreeSet<>();
	// s starts as {0, 1, 2}
	s.add(0); s.add(1); s.add(2);

	Set<Integer> toRemove = new TreeSet<>();
	for (Integer a : s) {
		if (a == 0 || a == 2) {
			toRemove.add(a);
		}
	}

	s.removeAll(toRemove);

	// s ends as {1}
	System.out.println("ENTRIES:");
	for (Integer a : s) {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
}
/*
ENTRIES:
1
*/
```

## Problems

Some of these problems can be solved by sorting alone, though sets or maps could
make their implementation easier.
