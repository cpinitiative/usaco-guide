## Introduction

<Resources>

</Resources>

A **set** is a collection of unique elements. Sets have three primary methods:

 - one to add an element
 - one to remove an element
 - one to check whether an element is present


A **map** is a collection of entries, each consisting of a **key** and a **value**. In
a map, all keys are required to be unique (i.e., they will form a set), but values can be repeated. Maps have
three primary methods:

- one to add a specified key-value pairing
- one to remove a key-value pairing
- one to retrieve the value for a given key

C++ and Java both have two implementations of sets and maps; one uses **sorting** while the other uses **hashing.** Python's implementation of sets and maps uses hashing.

## Sets

<FocusProblem problem="dis" />


### Sorted Sets

Sorted sets store elements in sorted order. All primary methods (adding, removing, and checking) run in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ worst-case time, where $N$ is the number
of elements in the set.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

Sorted sets are implemented in C++ by
[`std::set`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) in the `<set>` header. Some basic operations on an `std::set` named `s` include:

- `s.insert(x)`, which adds the element `x` to `s` if not already present.
- `s.erase(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `s` if present.
- `s.count(x)`, which returns `1` if `s` contains `x` and `0` if it doesn't.

You can also iterate through a set in sorted order using a for-each loop.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

void demo() {
	set<int> s;
	s.insert(1);                 // [1]
	s.insert(4);                 // [1, 4]
	s.insert(2);                 // [1, 2, 4]
	s.insert(1);                 // does nothing because 1's already in the set
	cout << s.count(1) << endl;  // 1
	s.erase(1);                  // [2, 4]
	cout << s.count(5) << endl;  // 0
	s.erase(0);                  // does nothing because 0 wasn't in the set
	s.insert(6);                 // [2, 4, 6]

	// Outputs 2, 4, and 6 separated by spaces
	for (int element : s) { cout << element << " "; }
}
```
</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Sorted sets are implemented in Java by the `TreeSet` class.

`TreeSet` includes all the operations that `HashSet` has, but also includes some
additional ones. Refer to the
[More Operations on Sorted Sets](/silver/intro-sorted-sets)
module for more detail.

You can iterate through a `TreeSet` in sorted order using a for-each loop.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
set.add(1);  // {1}
set.add(4);  // {1, 4}
set.add(2);  // {1, 2, 4}

/*
 * Output:
 * 1
 * 2
 * 4
 */

for (int element : set) { System.out.println(element); }
```

### Hashsets

Hashsets store elements using hashing. Roughly, a hashset consists of some number of buckets $B$, and each element is mapped to a bucket via a hash function. If $B\approx N$ and the hash function independently maps each distinct element to a uniformly random bucket, then no bucket is expected to contain many elements, and all primary methods will all run in $\mathcal O(1)$ *expected* time.


<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

<Warning>

In the worst case, hashsets in C++ may take proportional to $N$ time per operation. This will be demonstrated later in the module.

</Warning>

Hashsets are implemented in C++ by
[`std::unordered_set`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/)
in the `<unordered_set>` header.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

void demo() {
	unordered_set<int> s;
	s.insert(1);                 // {1}
	s.insert(4);                 // {1, 4}
	s.insert(2);                 // {1, 2, 4}
	s.insert(1);                 // does nothing because 1's already in the set
	cout << s.count(1) << endl;  // 1
	s.erase(1);                  // {2, 4}
	cout << s.count(5) << endl;  // 0
	s.erase(0);                  // does nothing because 0 wasn't in the set
	s.insert(6);                 // {2, 4, 6}

	// Outputs 6, 2, and 4 separated by spaces (not in sorted order)
	for (int element : s) { cout << element << " "; }
}
```

Hashsets work with primitive types, but require a
[custom hash function](/gold/hashmaps#custom-hashing)
for structures/classes like `vector`s and `pair`s.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

<Warning>

In the worst case, hashsets in Java may take proportional to $\mathcal O(\log N)$ time per operation, same as sorted sets ([ref](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62393?#comment-464875)).

</Warning>


Hashsets are implemented in Java by the
[`HashSet`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html)
class (which comes from the `java.util` library).

Some operations on a `HashSet` named `set` include:

- `set.add(x)`, which adds the element `x` to `set` if not already present.
- `set.remove(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `set` if present.
- `set.contains(x)`, which checks whether `set` contains the element `x`.

Hashsets work with primitive types and their object wrappers, but require
a [custom hash function](/gold/hashmaps#custom-hashing)
for custom classes.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(1);  // {1}
set.add(4);  // {1, 4}
set.add(2);  // {1, 4, 2}
set.add(1);  // {1, 4, 2}
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
System.out.println(set.contains(1));  // true
set.remove(1);                        // {4, 2}
System.out.println(set.contains(5));  // false
set.remove(0);                        // does nothing because 0 wasn't in the set
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

<Warning>

In the worst case, hashsets in Python may take proportional to $N$ time per operation. This will be demonstrated later in the module.

</Warning>


Python's built-in `set` uses hashing to support $\mathcal{O}(1)$ insertion,
deletion, and searches. Some operations on a Python `set` named `s` include:

- `s.add(x)`: adds element `x` to `s` if not already present
- `s.remove(x)`: removes an element `x` from `set` if present
- `x in s`: checks whether `s` contains the element `x`

```py
s = set()
s.add(1)  # {1}
s.add(4)  # {1, 4}
s.add(2)  # {1, 4, 2}
s.add(1)  # {1, 4, 2}
# the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
print(1 in s)  # True
s.remove(1)  # {4, 2}
print(5 in s)  # False
s.remove(0)  # {4, 2}
# if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens
```

### Solution - Distinct Numbers

This problem asks us to calculate the number of distinct values in a given list.

#### Method 1 - Sorted Set

Because sets only store one copy of each value, we can insert all the numbers
into a set, and then print out the size of the set.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	set<int> distinctNumbers;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int number;
		cin >> number;
		distinctNumbers.insert(number);
	}

	cout << distinctNumbers.size() << endl;
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
// Source: Daniel

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class DistinctNumbers {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();
		int n = io.nextInt();
		Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { set.add(io.nextInt()); }
		io.println(set.size());
		io.close();
	}

	// CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

<Warning>

Ignore this section, as Python doesn't implement sorted sets.

</Warning>

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

#### Method 2 - Hashset



<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

Same as method 1, but with sorted set replaced by a hashset.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	unordered_set<int> distinctNumbers;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int number;
		cin >> number;
		distinctNumbers.insert(number);
	}

	cout << distinctNumbers.size() << endl;
}
```

However, this fails on one test designed specifically to cause `unordered_set` to run in $\Theta(N^2)$ time. To get around this, you can either switch to `set` or use a [custom hash function](/gold/hashmaps?lang=cpp#anti-hash-tests).

<Info title="Should I worry about anti-hash tests in USACO?">

No - historically, no USACO problem has included an anti-hash test. However, these sorts of tests often appear in Codeforces, especially in educational rounds, where open hacking is allowed.

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

public class DistinctNumbers {

		Kattio io = new Kattio();
		int n = io.nextInt();
		Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { set.add(io.nextInt()); }
		io.println(set.size());
		io.close();
	}

	// CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

```py
n = int(input())  # unused
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
distinct_nums = set(nums)
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

Or we can do this more concisely by skipping the creation of the list, and use a
set comprehension directly:

```py
n = int(input())  # unused
distinct_nums = {int(x) for x in input().split()}
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

However, it is possible to construct a test case that causes the above solution to run in $\Theta(N^2)$ time, so this solution does *not* receive full credit.


<Spoiler title="Hack Case Generator">

```py
# source: https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3725
import time


def anti_hash_hack(n: int, cpython: bool = False, for_set=False):
	"""

	"""
	pow2 = 2 ** (n.bit_length() + 2)

	A = []

	def add_all(x):
		for i in range(10 if (cpython and for_set) else 1):
			A.append(x + i)

	add_all(pow2 + 1)
	i = 6 if cpython else 7
	while len(A) < n // 2:
		assert i > 0
		add_all(i)
		i = (5 * i + 1) % pow2

	while len(A) < n:
		A.append(1)

	return A


N = 200000
A = anti_hash_hack(N, False, False)

# https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1640/
print_test = False
if print_test:
	print(N, 1)
	print(" ".join(str(x) for x in A))

do_test = True
if do_test:
	print("Creating set:")
	start = time.time()
	set(A)
	print("Done", time.time() - start)

	print("Creating dict:")
	start = time.time()
	my_dict = {}
	for i in range(N):
		my_dict[A[i]] = i
	print("Done", time.time() - start)
```

</Spoiler>

One way to get around this with high probability is to incorporate randomness; see [this comment](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/101817?#comment-903524) for more information.

```py
import random

RANDOM = random.randrange(2**62)


def Wrapper(x):
	return x ^ RANDOM


n = int(input())  # unused
distinct_nums = {Wrapper(int(x)) for x in input().split()}
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

Another (less efficient) way is to use strings instead of integers since the hash function for strings is randomized.

```py
n = int(input())  # unused
distinct_nums = set(input().split())
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

<Info title="Should I worry about anti-hash tests in USACO?">

No - historically, no USACO problem has included an anti-hash test. However, these sorts of tests often appear in Codeforces, especially in educational rounds, where open hacking is allowed.

#### Method 3 - Sorting

Check out the [solution](/solutions/cses-1621) involving sorting.



## Maps

<FocusProblem problem="ex" />

In sorted maps, the pairs are sorted in order of key. As with sorted sets, all primary methods run in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ worst-case time, where $N$ is the number of pairs in the map.

In hashmaps, the pairs are hashed to buckets by the key, and as with hashsets, all primary methods run in $\mathcal O(1)$ expected time under some assumptions about the hash function.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In C++, sorted maps are
implemented with `std::map` and hashmaps are implemented with
`std::unordered_map`.

Some operations on an `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` named `m` include:

- `m[key]`, which returns a reference to the value associated with the key
  `key`.
  - If `key` is not present in the map, then the value associated with `key` is
    constructed using the default constructor of the value type. For example, if
    the value type is `int`, then calling `m[key]` for a key not within the map
    sets the value associated with that key to `0`. As another example, if the
    value type is `std::string`, then calling `m[key]` for a key not within the
    map sets the value associated with that key to the empty string. More
    discussion regarding what happens in this case can be found
    [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10124679/what-happens-if-i-read-a-maps-value-where-the-key-does-not-exist).
  - Alternatively, `m.at(key)` behaves the same as `m[key]` if `key` is
    contained within `m` but throws an exception otherwise.
  - `m[key] = value` will assign the value `value` to the key `key`.
- `m.count(key)`, which returns the number of times the key is in the map
  (either one or zero), and therefore checks whether a key exists in the map.
- `m.erase(key)`, which removes the map entry associated with the specified key
  if the key was present in the map.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

void demo() {
	map<int, int> m;
	m[1] = 5;                    // [(1, 5)]
	m[3] = 14;                   // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
	m[2] = 7;                    // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
	m[0] = -1;                   // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
	m.erase(2);                  // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (3, 14)]
	cout << m[1] << endl;        // 5
	cout << m.count(7) << endl;  // 0
	cout << m.count(1) << endl;  // 1
	cout << m[2] << endl;        // 0
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In Java, sorted maps are implemented
with `TreeMap` and hashmaps are implemented with `HashMap`.

In both `TreeMap` and `HashMap`, the `put(key, value)` method assigns a value to
a key and places the key and value pair into the map. The `get(key)` method
returns the value associated with the key. The `containsKey(key)` method checks
whether a key exists in the map. Lastly, `remove(key)` removes the map entry
associated with the specified key.

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();
map.put(1, 5);                           // [(1, 5)]
map.put(3, 14);                          // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
map.put(2, 7);                           // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
map.remove(2);                           // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
System.out.println(map.get(1));          // 5
System.out.println(map.containsKey(7));  // false
System.out.println(map.containsKey(1));  // true
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Colloquially, hashmaps are referred to as **dicts** in python.

```py
d = {}
d[1] = 5  # {1: 5}
d[3] = 14  # {1: 5, 3: 14}
d[2] = 7  # {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 14}
del d[2]  # {1: 5, 3: 14}
print(d[1])  # 5
print(7 in d)  # False
print(1 in d)  # True
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

### Iterating Over Maps

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

An `std::map` stores entries as [pairs](/bronze/intro-ds#pairs) in the
form `{key, value}`. To iterate over maps, you can use a `for` loop.
The `auto` keyword suffices to iterate over any type of pair
(here, `auto` substitutes for `pair<int, int>`).

```cpp
// Both of these output the same thing
for (const auto &x : m) { cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl; }
for (auto x : m) { cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl; }
```

The first method (iterating over const references) is generally preferred over
the second because the second will make a copy of each element that it iterates
over. Additionally, you can pass by reference when iterating over a map,
allowing you to modify the values (but not the keys) of the pairs stored in the
map:

```cpp
for (auto &x : m) {
	x.second = 1234;  // Change all values to 1234
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

To iterate over maps, you can use a for-each loop over the keys:

```java
for (int k : m.keySet()) { System.out.println(k + " " + m.get(k)); }
```

You can also use a for-each loop over the entries:

```java
for (Map.Entry entry : m.entrySet()) {
	System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
}
```

It's also possible to change the values while iterating over the keys
(or over the values themselves, if they're mutable):

```java
for (int k : m.keySet()) {
	m.put(k, 1234);  // Change all values to 1234
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

To iterate over `dict`s, there are three options, all of which involve for loops.
Dicts will be returned in the same order of insertion in
[Python 3.6+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323).
You can iterate over the keys:

```py
for key in d:
	print(key)
```

Over the values:

```py
for value in d.values():
	print(value)
```

And even over key-value pairs:

```py
for key, value in d.items():
	print(key, value)
```

It's also possible to change the values while iterating over the keys
(or over the values themselves, if they're mutable):

```py
for key in d:
	d[key] = 1234  # Change all values to 1234
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

While you are free to change the _values_ in a map when iterating over it (as
demonstrated above), it is generally a bad idea to insert or remove elements of
a map while iterating over it.

<LanguageSection>
<PySection>

For example, the following code attempts to remove every entry from a map, but
results in a runtime error.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}

for i in d:
	del d[i]
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 3, in <module>
    for i in d:
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

One way is to get around this is to create a new map.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}

# only includes every third element
d_new = dict(item for i, item in enumerate(d.items()) if i % 3 == 0)

print("new dict:", d_new)  # new dict: {0: 0, 3: 3, 6: 6, 9: 9}
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to remove and remove them
after the iteration finishes:

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}

# removes every third element
to_remove = {key for i, key in enumerate(d) if i % 3 == 0}

for key in to_remove:
	del d[key]

print("new dict:", d)  # new dict: {1: 1, 2: 2, 4: 4, 5: 5, 7: 7, 8: 8}
```

</PySection>
<CPPSection>

For example, the following code attempts to remove every entry from a map, but
results in a segmentation fault.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) m[i] = i;

for (auto &it : m) {
	cout << "Current Key: " << it.first << endl;

	m.erase(it.first);
}
```

The reason is due to "iterators, pointers and references referring to elements
removed by the function [being] invalidated" (as stated in the documentation for
[`erase`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/erase/)), though iterators
are beyond the scope of this module.

One way to get around this is to just create a new map instead of removing from
the old one.

```cpp
map<int, int> m, M;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) m[i] = i;

int current_iteration = 0;

for (const auto &it : m) {
	// only includes every third element
	if (current_iteration % 3 == 0) { M[it.first] = it.second; }

	current_iteration++;
}

swap(m, M);

cout << "Entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m) { cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl; }
/*
 * Entries:
 * 0 0
 * 3 3
 * 6 6
 * 9 9
 */
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to erase and erase them
after the iteration finishes.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { m[i] = i; }

vector<int> to_erase;
int current_iteration = 0;

for (const auto &it : m) {
	// removes every third element
	if (current_iteration % 3 == 0) { to_erase.push_back(it.first); }

	current_iteration++;
}

for (int key : to_erase) { m.erase(key); }

cout << "Remaining entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m) { cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl; }

/*
 * Remaining entries:
 * 1 1
 * 2 2
 * 4 4
 * 5 5
 * 7 7
 * 8 8
 */
```

Modifying a Collection (`Set`, `Map`, etc.) in the middle of a for-each loop
will cause a
[ConcurrentModificationException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html).
See the following snippet for an example:

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
// m starts as {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
m.put(0, 0);
m.put(1, 1);
m.put(2, 2);

for (int key : m.keySet()) {
	m.remove(key);  // ConcurrentModificationException thrown!!
}
```

One work-around is to use `Iterator` and the `.remove()` method to remove
elements while looping over them, like in the next code snippet:

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
// m starts as {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
m.put(0, 0);
m.put(1, 1);
m.put(2, 2);

Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> iter = m.entrySet().iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()) {
	int key = iter.next().getKey();
	if (key == 0 || key == 2) { iter.remove(); }
}

// m ends as {1: 1}
System.out.println("Remaining Entries:");
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : m.entrySet()) {
	System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
}
```

However, `Iterator` is outside the scope of this module.

The easiest option (in most cases) if you want to remove/insert multiple entries
at once is to use your Container's `.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` methods. That
means that you should put all the elements you want to remove (or add) in a new
Collection, and then use that new Collection as the parameter of the
`.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` method that you call on your original
Collection. See the following code snippet for an example (it works equivalently
to the code above):

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
// m starts as {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
m.put(0, 0);
m.put(1, 1);
m.put(2, 2);

Set<Integer> keysToRemove = new TreeSet<>();
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : m.entrySet()) {
	int key = entry.getKey();
	if (key == 0 || key == 2) { keysToRemove.add(key); }
}

// removes all entries with key in keysToRemove
m.keySet().removeAll(keysToRemove);

// m ends as {1: 1}
System.out.println("Remaining Entries:");
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : m.entrySet()) {
	System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
}
```

### Solution - Associative Array

To solve this problem efficiently, we need a data structure that can:

- Assign a value to any index `k` (where `k` can be as large as $10^{18}$).
- Retrieve the value at any index `k` quickly.

A regular array won't work because the indices can be extremely large, making it impossible to allocate enough memory. However, since all values are initially `0` and only a small subset of indices will ever be set or queried, we can use a **map** (also called an associative array or dictionary) to store only the indices that have been assigned a value.

- When we receive a `0 k v` query, we set `a[k] = v` in the map.
- When we receive a `1 k` query, we print `a[k]` if it exists in the map, or `0` otherwise.

This approach is efficient because both operations are fast in maps, and we only store the keys that are actually used.

Note that we use 64-bit integers since $k$ and $v$ may be large.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int query_num;
	cin >> query_num;
	map<long long, long long> a;  // Map to store only assigned indices
	for (int q = 0; q < query_num; q++) {
		int t;
		cin >> t;
		if (t == 0) {
			long long k, v;
			cin >> k >> v;
			a[k] = v;
		} else if (t == 1) {
			long long k;
			cin >> k;
			// If k is not in the map, operator[] returns 0 by default
			cout << a[k] << '\n';
		}
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int queryNum = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		// Map to store assigned indices
		HashMap<Long, Long> a = new HashMap<Long, Long>();
		for (int i = 0; i < queryNum; i++) {
			StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
			long t = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());
			long k = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());
			if (t == 0) {
				long v = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());
				a.put(k, v);
			} else if (t == 1) {
				// If k is not present, return 0
				System.out.println(a.getOrDefault(k, 0L));
			}
		}
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

Unfortunately, the straightforward solution fails a few tests specifically designed to make Python `dict`s run slowly:

```py
a = dict()  # Dictionary to store assigned indices
for _ in range(int(input())):
	nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
	if nums[0] == 0:
		a[nums[1]] = nums[2]
	elif nums[0] == 1:
		# Print a[k] if present, else 0
		print(a.get(nums[1], 0))
```

To pass all the tests, we can use one of the workarounds mentioned for `set`.

```py
import random

RANDOM = random.randrange(2**62)


def wrap(x):
	return x ^ RANDOM


a = dict()  # Dictionary to store assigned indices
for _ in range(int(input())):
	nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
	if nums[0] == 0:
		a[wrap(nums[1])] = nums[2]
	elif nums[0] == 1:
		# Print a[k] if present, else 0
		print(a.get(wrap(nums[1]), 0))
```
