import { Problem } from '../models';

export const problems = {
	bubble: [
		new Problem(
			'HR',
			'Bubble Sort',
			'https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort/problem',
			'Very Easy',
			false,
			[],
			''
		),
	],
	dis: [
		new Problem(
			'CF',
			'Kayaking',
			'contest/863/problem/B',
			'Easy',
			true,
			[],
			"Loop over all pairs of people too put in the single Kayaks. Then, sort the remaining people and pair $a_i$ with $a_{i + 1}$ because this minimizes the sum of absolute values (draw some cases if you're confused why)."
		),
	],
};

**Sorting** refers to arranging items in some particular order.

<Warning>

Bronze problems are (almost always) designed that you shouldn't need to sort, though the concept can come in very handy for some problems. This module is optional for Bronze contestants.

## Sorting Methods

<FocusProblem problem={problems.bubble[0]} />

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="3.1 - Sorting Theory" starred>
		bubble sort, merge sort, counting sort
	</Resource>
	<Resource source="CSA" title="Sorting" url="sorting">
		selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort
	</Resource>
</Resources>

<!-- No bronze problem should require you to sort an array in $O(N\log N)$ time for Bronze,  -->

## Library Sorting

Although you usually do **not** need to know how sorting is implemented, you should know how to use built-in methods.

### (Dynamic) Arrays

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In order to sort a dynamic array, use `sort(v.begin(), v.end())` (or `sort(begin(v),end(v))`), whereas static arrays require `sort(arr, arr + N)` where $N$ is the number of elements to be sorted. The default sort function sorts the array in ascending order.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In order to sort a static or dynamic array, use `Arrays.sort(arr)` or `Collections.sort(list)` respectively. The default sort function sorts the array in ascending order.

- [Arrays.sort](<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort(java.lang.Object[])>)
- [Collections.sort](<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List)>)

<Warning>

The `Arrays.sort()` function uses quicksort on primitive data types such as `long`s. This is fine for USACO, but in other contests such as CodeForces, it may time out on test cases specifically engineered to trigger worst-case $\Theta(N^2)$ behavior in quicksort.

</Warning>

See [here](https://codeforces.com/contest/1324/hacks/625031/) for an example of a solution that was hacked on CodeForces.

Two ways to avoid this:

- Declare the underlying array as an array of objects, for example `Long` instead of `long`. This forces the `Arrays.sort()` function to use mergesort, which is always $O(N \log N)$.
- [Shuffle](https://pastebin.com/k6gCRJDv) the array beforehand.

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

In order to sort a list, simply use the `sorted(list)` function.

### (Dynamic) Arrays of Pairs & Tuples

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

By default, C++ pairs are sorted by first element and then second element in case of a tie.

```cpp
// Source: CPH

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<pair<int,int>> v;
	v.push_back({1,5});
	v.push_back({2,3});
	v.push_back({1,2});
	sort(v.begin(), v.end());
	for (pair<int,int> p: v) cout << p.first << " " << p.second << "\n";
}

/* Output:
1 2
1 5
2 3
*/
```

Tuples are sorted similarly.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

You'll need to define your own **custom comparator**. This is covered in [Silver](/silver/sorting-custom).

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

By default, Python tuples sort by first element, then second element, and so on in case of repeated ties.

```py

list = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)]
list = sorted(list)
for x, y in list:
    print(f'{x}, {y}')

# Output:
# 1, 2
# 2, 1
# 2, 3
# 3, 1
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

## Problems

<Problems problems={problems.dis} />

There are some more sorting problems in the [Intro to Sets](/intro/intro-sets) module.

<!-- 

what about USACO problems? (though sorting is _very_ rare in Bronze)

I added one, but I can't find anything else -->
