## Greedy Algorithms

Some USACO Bronze problems that appear to be Ad Hoc can actually be solved using **greedy** algorithms. This idea will be covered in a future [module](/silver/greedy), but we'll introduce the general mindset in this section.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="6.1 - Coin Problem" starred>
		other examples are outside scope of bronze
	</Resource>
</Resources>

<Warning>

True **"greedy"** problems start to show up in silver, though the greedy mindset can be very helpful for bronze problems.

</Warning>

From the above:

> A **greedy** algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back its choices, but directly constructs the final solution. For this reason, greedy algorithms are usually very efficient.

**Greedy** does not refer to a single algorithm, but rather a way of thinking that is applied to problems; there's no one way to do greedy algorithms. Hence, we use a selection of well-known examples to help you understand the greedy paradigm.

### Example: Mad Scientist

<FocusProblem problem={problems.tutorial[0]} />

Try to come up with a greedy algorithm for problem above.

<Spoiler title="Correct Greedy Algorithm">

In this problem, the correct greedy solution is to continually flip the longest possible ranges of mismatching cows.

Mad Scientist has an excellent [editorial](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_breedflip_bronze_feb20.html) with a video solution and intuitive proof.

It is highly recommended you read it to gain a better understanding of the greedy algorithm.

<LanguageSection>

<PySection>

```py
import sys
sys.stdin = open("breedflip.in","r")
sys.stdout = open("breedflip.out","w")

N,a,b = input(),input(),input()
s = [False]+[x != y for x,y in zip(a,b)] # difference list
# now count occurrences of [False,True], as the first C++ solution does
print(sum(1 if not x and y else 0 for x,y in zip(s,s[1:]))) 
```

<!-- 
```python
fin, fout = open('breedflip.in'), open('breedflip.out', 'w')

n = int(fin.readline())

a = fin.readline()
b = fin.readline()

s = []
for x in range(n):
    if a[x] != b[x]:
        s.append(1)
    else:
        s.append(0)

def count(x,s):
    count = 0
    for f in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[f] == int(x[0]) and s[f+ 1] == int(x[1]):
            count += 1

    return count

s = [0] + s + [0]
fout.write(str((count('01', s) + count('10', s))//2))
```

Note that not all greedy problems necessarily require mathematical proofs of correctness. It is often sufficent to intuitively convince yourself your algorithm is correct.

<Info title="Pro Tip">

Sometimes, if the algorithm is easy enough to implement, you don't even need to convince yourself it's correct; just code it and see if it passes. Competitive programmers refer to this as "Proof by AC," or "Proof by Accepted."
