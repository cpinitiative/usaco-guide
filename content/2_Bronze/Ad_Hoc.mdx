<!-- Most USACO Bronze problems fall into specific categories, such as simulation and complete search. Those which don't often require more thought, although they are not necessarily more difficult to implement. -->

According to USACO Training 1.2:

> **Ad hoc** problems are those whose algorithms do not fall into standard
> categories with well-studied solutions. Each ad hoc problem is different; no
> specific or general techniques exist to solve them.

<!-- Any problem that doesn't fall under any well-defined category can be labelled as **ad hoc**. Since there is no fixed algorithm or idea to solving these problems, they can be hard to generalize.  -->

In this module, we'll go over some general tips that may be useful in
approaching problems that _appear_ to be ad hoc.

- Draw lots of small cases to gain a better understanding of the problem. If
  you're having trouble debugging, draw more cases. If you don't know how to
  start with a problem, draw more cases. Whenever you don't know how to further
  approach a problem, you're probably missing an important observation, so draw
  more cases and make observations about properties of the problem.
- Whenever you find an observation that seems useful, write it down! Writing
  down ideas lets you easily come back to them later, and makes sure you don't
  forget about ideas that could potentially be the solution.
- Don't get stuck on any specific idea, unless you see an entire solution.
  Trying to complete search an ad hoc problem could end up wasting a lot of your
  time in contest.
- Try to approach the problem from a lot of different perspectives. Try to mess
  around with formulas or draw a visual depiction of the problem (maybe some
  sort of [graph](/bronze/intro-graphs)). One of the most helpful things you can
  do when solving ad hoc problems is to keep trying ideas until you make
  progress. This is something you get better at as you do more problems.

<!-- Try to solve as many practice problems below as you can, and click the solution sketch tab if you can't figure the solution out. -->

<!-- If anyone disagrees with any of the tips / ideas presented in the blogs below, just let me know. I think they're quite interesting, though I haven't tried it out myself. -->

In the end, the best way to get better at ad hoc problems (or any type of
problem) is to do a lot of them.

## Problems

<!-- Don't you love Dhruv Rohatgi problems? -->

Of course, ad hoc problems can be
[quite easy](/general/expected-knowledge#problem-usaco-591), but the ones presented below
are generally on the harder side.
