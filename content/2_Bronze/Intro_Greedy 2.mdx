## Greedy Algorithms

Some USACO Bronze problems that appear to be ad hoc can actually be solved using
**greedy** algorithms. This idea will be covered in a future
[module](/silver/greedy-sorting), but we'll introduce the general mindset in
this section.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="6.1 - Coin Problem" starred>
		other examples are outside scope of bronze
	</Resource>
</Resources>

<Warning>

True **"greedy"** problems start to show up in silver, though the greedy mindset
can be very helpful for bronze problems.

</Warning>

From the above:

> choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back
> its choices, but directly constructs the final solution. For this reason,
> greedy algorithms are usually very efficient.

**Greedy** does not refer to a single algorithm, but rather a way of thinking
that is applied to problems; there's no one way to do greedy algorithms. Hence,
we use a selection of well-known examples to help you understand the greedy
paradigm.

### Example - Mad Scientist

<FocusProblem problem="tutorial" />

Try to come up with a greedy algorithm for problem above.

<Spoiler title="Correct Greedy Algorithm">

In this problem, the correct greedy solution is to continually flip the longest
possible ranges of mismatching cows.

Mad Scientist has an excellent
[editorial](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_breedflip_bronze_feb20.html)
with a video solution and intuitive proof.

It is highly recommended you read it to gain a better understanding of the
greedy algorithm.

[official analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_breedflip_bronze_feb20.html):

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

int main() {
	freopen("breedflip.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("breedflip.out", "w", stdout);
	ll n;
	cin >> n;
	string A;
	string B;
	cin >> A >> B;
	ll ans = 0;
	bool mismatched = false;
	for(ll i=0; i<n; i++) {
		if(A[i] != B[i]) {
			if(!mismatched) {
				mismatched = true;
				ans++;
			}
		} else {
			mismatched = false;
		}
	}
	cout << ans << endl;

(with Kattio added):

		Kattio io = new Kattio("breedflip");
		int n = io.nextInt();
		char[] a = io.next().toCharArray();
		char[] b = io.next().toCharArray();
		int ret = 0;
		while (!new String(a).equals(new String(b))) {
			ret++;
			int lhs = 0;
			while (a[lhs] == b[lhs]) lhs++;
			int rhs = n-1;
			while (a[rhs] == b[rhs]) rhs--;
			for (int i = lhs; i <= rhs; i++) {
				if (a[i] == 'G') a[i] = 'H';

N,a,b = input(),input(),input()
s = [False]+[x != y for x,y in zip(a,b)] # difference list
# now count occurrences of [False,True], as the first C++ solution does
print(sum(1 if not x and y else 0 for x,y in zip(s,s[1:])))

Note that not all greedy problems necessarily require mathematical proofs of
correctness. It is often sufficent to intuitively convince yourself your
algorithm is correct.

<Info title="Pro Tip">

Sometimes, if the algorithm is easy enough to implement, you don't even need to
convince yourself it's correct; just code it and see if it passes. Competitive
programmers refer to this as "Proof by AC," or "Proof by Accepted."

## Quiz
	
<Quiz>
  <Quiz.Question>
    What is a greedy algorithm?
    <Quiz.Answer>
      An algorithm which backtracks in order to find the most optimal solution.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Incorrect. Although greedy algorithms can use backtracking, this is not true for all of them.
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      An algorithm which makes the locally optimal choice at each stage.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Correct. This allows a greedy algorithm to be very efficient and often easier to code.
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer>
      An algorithm which tries every possible combination in order to find the most optimal outcome.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Incorrect. This is known as [complete search](/bronze/intro-complete) or [brute force](/bronze/intro-complete).
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
  </Quiz.Question>
  <Quiz.Question>
    Why would a greedy algorithm be preferred over a complete search algorithm when faced with a large input size? 
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      Since greedy algorithms directly construct an answer, greedy algorithms are generally more efficient.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Correct.
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer>
      Since finding an optimal choice is often easier than doing casework for all pairs, greedy algorithms are easier to implement.
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Incorrect. This varies for every problem.
      </Quiz.Explanation>
    </Quiz.Answer>
    <Quiz.Answer>
      Greedy algorithms are much easier to debug.
