# Introduction

Graphs can be used to represent many things, from images to wireless signals,
but one of the simplest analogies is to a map. Consider a map with several
cities and bidirectional roads connecting the cities. Some problems relating to
graphs are:

1.  Is city $A$ connected to city $B$? Consider a region to be a group of cities
    such that each city in the group can reach any other city in said group, but
    no other cities. How many regions are in this map, and which cities are in
    which region? (USACO Silver)

2.  What's the shortest distance I have to travel to get from city $A$ to city
    $B$? (USACO Gold)

For USACO Bronze, it suffices to learn the basics of how graphs are represented (usually **adjacency lists**).

# Constructing Adjacency Lists

Graphs are often given as input in the following format:

- The first line will contain the number of nodes $N$ and the number of edges $M$.
- Then follow $M$ lines, each containing a pair of integers specifying an edge of the graph.

For example, the undirected graph given in the [CSAcademy resource from above](https://csacademy.com/lesson/graph_representation) would be represented as the following input:

```
6 10
2 4
0 2
0 4
0 5
5 3
2 3
1 3
4 5
4 1
1 5
```

and could be visualized in the [CSAcademy graph editor](https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/):

The following code represents the graph using adjacency lists.
Once we have the graph in this representation, it is easy to print the number of neighbors of a node, or iterate over the neighbors of a node.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int N, M;
	cin >> N >> M;
	vector<vector<int>> adj(N);
	for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
		int u, v;
		cin >> u >> v;
		adj.at(u).push_back(v);
		adj.at(v).push_back(u);
	}
	{
		int u = 1;
		// print number of vertices adjacent to u
		cout << "deg(u) = " << adj.at(u).size() << endl;
		// print all edges with u as an endpoint
		for (int v : adj.at(u)) cout << "{" << u << ", " << v << "}" << "\n";
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

		StringTokenizer s1 = new StringTokenizer(reader.readLine());
		int N = Integer.parseInt(s1.nextToken());
		int M = Integer.parseInt(s1.nextToken());

		List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { adj.add(new ArrayList<>()); }

		for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
			StringTokenizer s2 = new StringTokenizer(reader.readLine());
			int u = Integer.parseInt(s2.nextToken());
			int v = Integer.parseInt(s2.nextToken());
			adj.get(u).add(v);
			adj.get(v).add(u);
		}

		int u = 1;
		// print number of vertices adjacent to u
		System.out.println("deg(u) = " + adj.get(u).size());
		// print all edges with u as an endpoint
		for (int v : adj.get(u)) { System.out.println("{" + u + ", " + v + "}"); }
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

```py
N, M = map(int, input().split())
adj = [[] for _ in range(N)]

for i in range(M):
	u, v = map(int, input().split())
	adj[u].append(v)
	adj[v].append(u)

u = 1
# print number of vertices adjacent to u
print("deg(u) =", len(adj[u]))
# print all edges with u as an endpoint
for v in adj[u]:
	print("{" + str(u) + ", " + str(v) + "}")
```
</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

Output:

```
deg(u) = 3
{1, 3}
{1, 4}
{1, 5}
```

# What Does a Bronze Graph Problem Look Like?

All of the problems below fall into at least one of the following two
categories:

- The graph's structure is special (it's a tree, path, or a cycle).
- To solve the problem, all you need to do is iterate over the adjacency list of
  every vertex.

In addition, knowledge of [Silver-level graph topics](/silver/graph-traversal) is usually helpful but not strictly required to solve the problem.

# Livestock Lineup

<FocusProblem problem="tutorial" />

While the intended solution is to brute force all possible permutations of the cows in $\mathcal O(N\cdot C!)$ time, we can solve the problem in just $\mathcal{O}(C)$ time if we represent the constraints using a graph.

## Solution Using Graphs

<Warning>

This explanation, and the implementation that follows, assume that all constraints
in the input describe distinct pairs of cows. If this assumption did not hold,
you would first need to remove duplicate constraints.

</Warning>

Notice that since the input is guaranteed to be valid, we're always going to end
up with "chains" of cows that we can arrange as we please. Using the sample given
in the problem, we'd get a "chain" representation like this:

![Chains](./assets/chains.png)

Note that cows that are not part of any chain can be considered their own chains
of length 1 for implementation purposes.

With this representation in mind, we can iterate through the cows in
lexicographical (alphabetical) order. When we visit a cow that could be a possible
start of a chain (a cow that has at most one required neighbor),
we repeatedly go through its neighbors, adding the cows we visit to the ordering, until we hit an end.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(C)$

    What is the space complexity for adjacency lists and adjacency matrices respectively? Let $n$ be the total number of nodes and $m$ be the total number of edges.
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      $\mathcal{O}(n + m)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Correct. An adjacency list consists of $n$ dynamic arrays, where the total sum of their lengths is $m$. Thus, since there are $n$ references and $m$ total elements for each edge, it has a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$. An adjacency matrix is an $n \times n$ matrix, leading us to an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space complexity.

      $\mathcal{O}(m)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
