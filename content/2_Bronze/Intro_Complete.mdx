In many problems (especially in Bronze) it suffices to check all possible cases
in the solution space, whether it be all elements, all pairs of elements, or all
subsets, or all permutations. Unsurprisingly, this is called **complete search**
(or **brute force**), because it completely searches the entire solution space.

<FocusProblem problem="sample" />

<Spoiler title="Solution">

We can iterate through every pair of points and find the square of the distance
between them, by squaring the formula for Euclidean distance:

$$
\text{distance}[(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)]^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2.
$$

Maintain the current maximum square distance in `max_square`.

A couple notes:

- Since we're iterating through all pairs of points, we start the $j$ loop from
  $j = i+1$ so that point $i$ and point $j$ are never the same point.
  Furthermore, it makes it so that each pair is only counted once. In this
  problem, it doesn't matter whether we double-count pairs or whether we allow
  $i$ and $j$ to be the same point, but in other problems where we're counting
  something rather than looking at the maximum, it's important to be careful
  that we don't overcount.
- Secondly, the problem asks for the square of the maximum Euclidean distance
  between any two points. Some students may be tempted to maintain the maximum
  distance in an integer variable, and then square it at the end when
  outputting. However, the problem here is that while the square of the distance
  between two integer points is always an integer, the distance itself isn't
  guaranteed to be an integer. Thus, we'll end up shoving a non-integer value
  into an integer variable, which truncates the decimal part.

The following solution correctly stores the maximum distance in a floating point
variable.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int N; cin >> N;
	vector<int> x(N), y(N);
	for (int& t: x) cin >> t;
	for (int& t: y) cin >> t;
	double max_dist = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { // for each first point
		for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++) { // for each second point
			int dx = x[i]-x[j], dy = y[i]-y[j];
			int square = dx*dx+dy*dy;
			// if the square of the distance between the two points is greater than
			// our current maximum, then update the maximum
			max_dist = max(max_dist,sqrt(square));
		}
	}
	cout << (int)pow(max_dist,2);
}
```
<Warning>
However, it still fails on the following test case (it outputs 12, but the
answer is 13):
</Warning>

```

0 3
2 0
```

Rounding suffices (`(int)round(pow(max_dist,2))`), but the takeaway is that you
should stick with integers whenever possible.
