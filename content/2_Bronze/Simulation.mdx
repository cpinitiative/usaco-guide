Since there's no formal algorithm involved, the intent of the problem is to
assess competence with one's programming language of choice and knowledge of
built-in data structures. At least in USACO Bronze, when a problem statement
says to find the end result of some process, or to find when something occurs,
it's usually sufficient to simulate the process naively<Asterisk>In competitive
programming, "naive" refers to solutions that are most intuitive or direct, and
the word doesn't carry its normal negative connotation. In fact, a naive
solution may not be the easiest to implement!</Asterisk>.

## Example 1

### Solution

<Spoiler title="Solution">

We can simulate the process. Store an array that keeps track of which shell is
at which location, and Bessie's swapping can be simulated by swapping elements
in the array. Then, we can count how many times Elsie guesses each shell, and
the maximum points she can earn is the maximum amount of times a shell is
guessed.

```cpp

using std::vector;

int main() {
	freopen("shell.in", "r", stdin);

	int n;
	scanf("%d", &n);

	// shell_at_pos[i] stores the label of the shell located at position i
	vector<int> shell_at_pos(3);
	// Place the shells down arbitrarily
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { shell_at_pos[i] = i; }

	// counter[i] stores the number of times the shell with label i was picked
	vector<int> counter(3);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int a, b, g;
		scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &g);
		// Zero indexing: offset all positions by 1
		a--, b--, g--;

		// Perform Bessie's swapping operation
		std::swap(shell_at_pos[a], shell_at_pos[b]);
		// Count the number of times Elsie guesses each particular shell
		counter[shell_at_pos[g]]++;
	}

	freopen("shell.out", "w", stdout);
	printf("%d\n", std::max({counter[0], counter[1], counter[2]}));

## Example 2

<FocusProblem problem="example2" />

### Solution

<Spoiler title="Solution">

We can simulate the process of pouring buckets. The amount of milk poured from
bucket $i$ to bucket $j$ is the smaller of the amount of milk in bucket $i$
(which is $m_i$) and the remaining space in bucket $j$ (which is $c_j - m_j$).
We can just handle all of these operations in order, using an array $c$ to store
the maximum capacities of each bucket, and an array $m$ to store the current
milk level in each bucket, which we update during the process. Example code is
below.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int N = 3;  // The number of buckets (which is 3)
const int TURN_NUM = 100;

int main() {
	freopen("mixmilk.in", "r", stdin);

	// capacity[i] is the maximum capacity of bucket i
	vector<int> capacity(N);
	// milk[i] is the current amount of milk in bucket i
	vector<int> milk(N);
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { scanf("%d %d", &capacity[i], &milk[i]); }

	for (int i = 0; i < TURN_NUM; i++) {
		int bucket1 = i % N;
		int bucket2 = (i + 1) % N;

		/*
		 * The amount of milk to pour is the minimum of the remaining milk
		 * in bucket 1 and the available capacity of bucket 2
		 */
		int amt = min(milk[bucket1], capacity[bucket2] - milk[bucket2]);

		milk[bucket1] -= amt;
		milk[bucket2] += amt;
	}

	freopen("mixmilk.out", "w", stdout);
	for (int m : milk) { cout << m << '\n'; }
}
```
