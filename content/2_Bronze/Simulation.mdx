Since there's no formal algorithm involved, the intent of the problem is to assess competence with one's programming language of choice and knowledge of built-in data structures. At least in USACO Bronze, when a problem statement says to find the end result of some process, or to find when something occurs, it's usually sufficient to simulate the process naively<Asterisk>In competitive programming, "naive" refers to solutions that are most intuitive or direct, and the word doesn't carry its normal negative connotation. In fact, a naive solution may not be the easiest to implement!</Asterisk>.

## Example 1

<FocusProblem problem={problems.example[0]} />

### Solution

<Spoiler title="Solution">

We can simulate the process. Store an array that keeps track of which shell is at which location, and Bessie's swapping can be simulated by swapping elements in the array. Then, we can count how many times Elsie guesses each shell, and the maximum points she can earn is the maximum amount of times a shell is guessed. 

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

int N, ord[3], cnt[3];
/*
N stores the number of guesses (as described in the problem statement)
ord[i] stores the label of the shell located at position i
cnt[i] stores the number of times the shell with label i was picked
*/

int main()
{
	freopen("shell.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("shell.out", "w", stdout);
	scanf("%d", &N);
	for(int i=0;i<3;++i)
		ord[i]=i; // We arbitrarily place the shells down (In this case, I happen to be putting the shell with label i at position i)
	for(int i=0;i<N;++i)
	{
		int a,b,g;
		scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &g);
		--a, --b, --g; // Zero indexing: offset all positions by 1
		std::swap(ord[a], ord[b]); // Perform Bessie's swapping operation
		++cnt[ord[g]]; // Count the number of times Elsie guesses each particular shell
	}
	printf("%d\n", std::max({cnt[0], cnt[1], cnt[2]}));
	return 0;
}

## Example 2

<FocusProblem problem={problems.example[1]} />

### Solution

<Spoiler title="Solution">

We can simulate the process of pouring buckets. The amount of milk poured from bucket $i$ to bucket $j$ is the smaller of the amount of milk in bucket $i$ (which is $m_i$) and the remaining space in bucket $j$ (which is $c_j - m_j$). We can just handle all of these operations in order, using an array $c$ to store the maximum capacities of each bucket, and an array $m$ to store the current milk level in each bucket, which we update during the process. Example code is below.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

const int N = 3;
int c[N], m[N];
/*
N is the number of buckets (which happens to be a constant value of 3)
c[i] is the maximum capacity of bucket i
m[i] is the current amount of milk in bucket i
*/

void pour(int i, int j)
{
	int amt=std::min(m[i], c[j]-m[j]);
	// Amount of milk to pour is the minimum of the remaining milk in bucket i and the available capacity in bucket j
	m[i] -= amt;
	m[j] += amt;
}

int main()
{
	freopen("mixmilk.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("mixmilk.out", "w", stdout);
	for(int i=0;i<N;++i)
		scanf("%d%d", c+i, m+i);
	for(int i=0;i<100;++i)
		pour(i%N, (i+1)%N); // Pour milk from one bucket to the next
	for(int i=0;i<N;++i)
		printf("%d\n", m[i]);
	return 0;
}
```
