### Solution - Apple Division

Since $n \le 20$, we can solve this by trying all possible divisions
of $n$ apples into two sets and finding the one with the minimum difference in
weights. Here are two ways to do this.

#### Generating Subsets Recursively

The first method would be to write a recursive function which searches over all
possibilities.

At some index, we either add $\texttt{weight}_i$ to the first set or the second
set, storing two sums $\texttt{sum}_1$ and $\texttt{sum}_2$ with the sum of
values in each set.

Then, we return the difference between the two sums once we've reached the end
of the array.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

int n;
vector<long long> weights;

ll recurse_apples(int index, ll sum1, ll sum2) {
	// We've added all apples- return the absolute difference
	if (index == n) { return abs(sum1 - sum2); }

	// Try adding the current apple to either the first or second set
	return min(recurse_apples(index + 1, sum1 + weights[index], sum2),
	           recurse_apples(index + 1, sum1, sum2 + weights[index]));
}

int main() {
	cin >> n;
	weights.resize(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> weights[i]; }

	// Solve the problem starting at apple 0 with both sets being empty
	cout << recurse_apples(0, 0, 0) << endl;
}
```

</CPPSection>

public class AppleDivision {
	static int n;
	static int[] weights;

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();

		n = io.nextInt();
		weights = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { weights[i] = io.nextInt(); }

		// Solve the problem starting at apple 0 with both sets being empty
		io.println(recurseApples(0, 0, 0));
		io.close();
	}

	static long recurseApples(int index, long sum1, long sum2) {
		// We've added all apples- return the absolute difference
		if (index == n) { return Math.abs(sum1 - sum2); }

		// Try adding the current apple to either the first or second set
		return Math.min(recurseApples(index + 1, sum1 + weights[index], sum2),
		                recurseApples(index + 1, sum1, sum2 + weights[index]));
	}

	if i == n:
		return abs(sum2 - sum1)

	# Try adding the current apple to either the first or second set
	return min(
		recurse_apples(i + 1, sum1 + weights[i], sum2),
		recurse_apples(i + 1, sum1, sum2 + weights[i]),
	)


# Solve the problem starting at apple 0 with both sets being empty
print(recurse_apples(0, 0, 0))
```

#### Generating Subsets with Bitmasks

<Warning>

You are not expected to know this for Bronze.

</Warning>

A **bitmask** is an integer whose binary representation is used to represent a
subset. In the context of this problem, if the $i$'th bit is equal to $1$ in a particular bitmask,
we say the $i$'th apple is in $s_1$. If not, we'll say it's in $s_2$.
We can iterate through all subsets $s_1$ if we check all bitmasks ranging from
$0$ to $2^N-1$.

Let's do a quick demo with $N=3$.
These are the integers from $0$ to $2^3-1$ along with their
binary representations and the corresponding elements included in $s_1$.
As you can see, all possible subsets are accounted for.

<center>

| Number | Binary | Apples In $s_1$ |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 0      | `000`  | $\{\}$          |
| 1      | `001`  | $\{0\}$         |
| 2      | `010`  | $\{1\}$         |
| 3      | `011`  | $\{0,1\}$       |
| 4      | `100`  | $\{2\}$         |
| 5      | `101`  | $\{0,2\}$       |
| 6      | `110`  | $\{1,2\}$       |
| 7      | `111`  | $\{0,1,2\}$     |

</center>

With this concept, we can implement our solution.

You'll notice that our code contains some fancy bitwise operations:

- `1 << x` for an integer $x$ is another way of writing $2^x$, which, in binary,
  has only the $x$'th bit turned on.
- The `&` (AND) operator will take two integers and return a new integer.
  `a & b` for integers $a$ and $b$ will return a new integer whose $i$th bit is
  turned on if and only if the $i$'th bit is turned on for both $a$ and $b$.
  Thus, `mask & (1 << x)` will return a positive value only if the $x$'th bit is
  turned on in $mask$.

If you wanna learn more about them, we have a
[dedicated module](/silver/intro-bitwise) for bitwise operations.

## Permutations

A **permutation** is a reordering of a list of elements.

<FocusProblem problem="permSam" />

### Lexicographical Order

This term is mentioned quite frequently, ex. in
[USACO Bronze - Photoshoot](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=988).

<!-- <Problems problems={"ex"} /> -->

Think about how are words ordered in a dictionary. (In fact, this is where the
term "lexicographical" comes from.)

In dictionaries, you will see that words beginning with the letter `a` appears
at the very beginning, followed by words beginning with `b`, and so on. If two
words have the same starting letter, the second letter is used to compare them;
if both the first and second letters are the same, then use the third letter to
compare them, and so on until we either reach a letter that is different, or we
reach the end of some word (in this case, the shorter word goes first).

Permutations can be placed into lexicographical order in almost the same way. We
first group permutations by their first element; if the first element of two
permutations are equal, then we compare them by the second element; if the
second element is also equal, then we compare by the third element, and so on.

For example, the permutations of 3 elements, in lexicographical order, are

$$
[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
$$

Notice that the list starts with permutations beginning with 1 (just like a
dictionary that starts with words beginning with `a`), followed by those
beginning with 2 and those beginning with 3. Within the same starting element,
the second element is used to make comparisions.

Generally, unless you are specifically asked to find the lexicographically
smallest/largest solution, you do not need to worry about whether permutations
are being generated in lexicographical order. However, the idea of
lexicographical order does appear quite often in programming contest problems,
and in a variety of contexts, so it is strongly recommended that you familiarize
yourself with its definition.

Some problems will ask for an ordering of elements that satisfies certain
conditions. In these problems, if $N \leq 10$, we can just iterate through all
$N!=N\cdot (N-1)\cdot (N-2)\cdots 1$ permutations and check each permutation for
validity.

### Solution - Creating Strings I

#### Generating Permutations Recursively

<!-- For a list of $N$ elements, there are  ways to permute them, and generally we'll need to read through each permutation once to check its validity, for a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot N!)$. -->

This is just a slight modification of method 1 from CPH.

We'll use the recursive function $\texttt{search}$ to find all the permutations
of the string $s$. First, keep track of how many of each character there are in
$s$. For each function call, add an available character to the current string,
and call $\texttt{search}$ with that string. When the current string has the
same size as $s$, we've found a permutation and can add it to the list of
$\texttt{perms}$.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string s;
vector<string> perms;
int char_count[26];

void search(const string &curr = "") {
	// We've finished creating a permutation
	if (curr.size() == s.size()) {
		perms.push_back(curr);
		return;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
		// For all available characters
		if (char_count[i] > 0) {
			// Add it to the current string and continue the search
			char_count[i]--;
			search(curr + (char)('a' + i));
			char_count[i]++;
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	cin >> s;
	for (char c : s) { char_count[c - 'a']++; }

	search();

	cout << perms.size() << '\n';
	for (const string &perm : perms) { cout << perm << '\n'; }
}
```

	static void search(String curr) {
		// We've finished creating a permutation
		if (curr.length() == s.length()) {
			perms.add(curr);
			return;
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
			// For all available characters
			if (charCount[i] > 0) {
				// Add it to the current string and continue the search
				charCount[i]--;
				search(curr + (char)(i + 'a'));
				charCount[i]++;
			}
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();
		s = io.next();

		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) { charCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++; }

		search("");

		io.println(perms.size());
		for (String perm : perms) { io.println(perm); }
		io.close();
	}

#### Generating Permutations Using [`next_permutation`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation)

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Mark Nelson"
		title="Next Permutation"
		url="https://marknelson.us/posts/2002/03/01/next-permutation.html"
		starred
	>
		explanation with an example
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Alternatively, we can just use the `next_permutation()` function. This function
takes in a range and modifies it to the next greater permutation. If there is no
greater permutation, it returns false. To iterate through all permutations,
place it inside a `do-while` loop. We are using a `do-while` loop here instead
of a typical `while` loop because a `while` loop would modify the smallest
permutation before we got a chance to process it.

What's going to be in the `check` function depends on the problem, but it should
verify whether the current permutation satisfies the constraints given in the
problem.

```cpp
do {
	check(v);  // process or check the current permutation for validity
} while (next_permutation(v.begin(), v.end()));
```

Each call to `next_permutation` makes a constant number of swaps on average if
we go through all $N!$ permutations of size $N$.

<Warning>

One small detail is that you need to sort the string before calling
`next_permutation()` because the method generates strings in lexicographical
order. If the string isn't sorted, then strings which are lexicographically
smaller than the initial string won't be generated.

</Warning>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	sort(s.begin(), s.end());

	// perms is a sorted list of all the permutations of the given string
	vector<string> perms;
	do { perms.push_back(s); } while (next_permutation(s.begin(), s.end()));

	cout << perms.size() << endl;
	for (const string &perm : perms) { cout << perm << endl; }
}
```

<PySection>

#### Generating Permutations Using [`itertools.permutations`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations)

Since `itertools.permutations` treats elements as unique based on position, not
value, it returns all permutations, with repeats. Putting the returned tuples in
a set can filter out duplicates, and since tuples are returned, we need to join
the characters into a string.

```py
from itertools import permutations

s = input()

# perms is a sorted list of all the permutations of the given string
perms = sorted(set(permutations(s)))

print(len(perms))
for perm in perms:
	print("".join(perm))
```

### Solution - Chessboard & Queens

#### By Generating Permutations

A brute-force solution that checks all $\binom{64}{8}$ possible queen
combinations will have over 4 billion arrangements to check, making it too slow.

We have to brute-froce a bit more intelligently.
To do this, we can directly generate permutations so that no two queens are
attacking each other due to being in the same row or column.

Since no two queens can be in the same column, it makes sense
to lay one out in each row.
It remains to figure out how to vary the *rows* each queen is in.
This can be done by generating all permutations from $1 \cdots 8$, with the
numbers representing which row each queen is in.

For example, the permutation $[6, 0, 5, 1, 4, 3, 7, 2]$ results in this
queen arrangement:

<table class="text-center">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>7</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>7</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Q</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Doing this cuts down the number of arrangements we have to check down to
a much more managable $8!$.

<Info title="Easier Diagonal Checking">

To make the implementation easier, notice that some bottom-left to
top-right diagonal can be represented as all squares $i, j$
($i$ being the row and $j$ being the column) such that $i + j = S$ for some $S$.
For example, all squares on the diagonal from $6, 0$ to $0, 6$ have their
coordinates sum to $6$.

Similarly, some bottom-right to top-left diagonal can
be represented as the same thing, but with $i-j$ instead of $i+j$.

#### Using Backtracking

According to CPH:

> A backtracking algorithm begins with an empty solution and extends the
> solution step by step. The search recursively goes through all different ways
> how a solution can be constructed.

Since the bounds are small, we can recursively backtrack over all ways to place
the queens, storing the current state of the board.

At each level, we try to place a queen at all squares that aren't blocked
or attacked by other queens.
After this, we recurse, then remove this queen and backtrack.

Finally, we increment the answer when we've placed all eight queens.

	  <Quiz.Question>
	    For what size of $n$ could we expect a solution that runs through all of the subsets of an array of length $n$ under reasonable time constraints?
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $n \leq 10^9$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: There are $2^n$ subsets of $n$ numbers. $2^{10^9}$ has around 301030000 digits which would take well until the heat death of the universe to finish generating all the subsets!

	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $n \leq 10^4$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: $n = 10^4$ is still too large
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer correct>
	      $n \leq 22$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Correct: This is just about right: $2^{22} \approx 10^7$, which is a bit less than the number of computations that the grading server can run in a second (which is around $10^8$).

	  <Quiz.Question>
	    What is the time complexity of the following code?

    	```cpp
    	vector<int> perm(n);
    	do {
    	} while (next_permutation(begin(perm), end(perm)));
    	```
        <Quiz.Answer>
          $\mathcal{O}(n)$
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Incorrect: Consider how many permutations there are in total
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer>
          $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Incorrect: Remember that permutations and subsets are different
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer correct>
          $\mathcal{O}(n!)$
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Correct: `std::next_permutation` in C++ will run in $\mathcal{O}(n!)$ time.
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer>
          $\mathcal{O}(n! \cdot n)$
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	  Incorrect: Although an iteration of `std::next_permutation` may take up to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, the total time amortizes to $\mathcal{O}(n!)$. In practice, however, this difference doesn't matter.

      <Quiz.Question>
        Why is using `std::next_permutation` generally preferable to writing your own recursive function to iterate through permutations?
        <Quiz.Answer>
          Recursion often runs into the issue of stack size, which can cause unexpected runtime errors
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Incorrect: Most complete search with permutations/subsets is that $n$ is small, usually $n\leq 20$. This means that recursion won't go particularly deep, and there won't be any issues with stack size.
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer correct>
          Using the C++ library function is easier and less buggy.
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Correct: Learning to use the C++ Standard Library to its full potential will save you a lot of time coding and debugging.
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer>
          Recursion introduces unnecessary overhead that often causes Time Limit Exceeded.
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Incorrect: Although recursion is slowing than iterative methods, it's still fast enough to pass most problems
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
      </Quiz.Question>
      <Quiz.Question>
        The following code is meant to generate all subsets of a given array:
    	```cpp
    	int A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    	void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
    		if (i == 5) {
    			for (int x : subset) cout << x << ' ';
    			cout << '\n';
    		}
    		subset.push_back(A[i]);
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    		subset.pop_back();
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    	}
    	```
        There is an error with this code that causes it to crash. What does the corrected code look like?
        <Quiz.Answer>
    	```cpp
    	void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
    		if (i == 5) {
    			for (int x : subset) cout << x << ' ';
    			cout << '\n';
    		}
    		// must always go to empty subset first
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    		subset.push_back(A[i]);
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    	}
    	```
    	<Quiz.Explanation>
    	Incorrect: This is another way of generating subsets, but it's not the error!
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer>
    	```cpp
    	void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
    		if (i == 4) {  // incorrect ending index
    			for (int x : subset) cout << x << ' ';
    			cout << '\n';
    		}
    		subset.push_back(A[i]);
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    		subset.pop_back();
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    	}
    	```

          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Incorrect: This doesn't stop the error and prevents us from adding the last number to any subset
          </Quiz.Explanation>
        </Quiz.Answer>
        <Quiz.Answer correct>
    	```cpp
    	void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
    		if (i == 5) {
    			for (int x : subset) cout << x << ' ';
    			cout << '\n';
    			return;  // missing return statement
    		}
    		subset.push_back(A[i]);
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    		subset.pop_back();
    		generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
    	}
    	```
          <Quiz.Explanation>
    	Correct: After we finish printing (or checking) the subset, remember to always return immediately. Otherwise, it causes nasty errors that often crashes the program.
