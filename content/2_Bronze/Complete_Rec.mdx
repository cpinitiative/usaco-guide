### Solution - Apple Division

Since $n\le 20$, we can solve the focus problem by trying all possible divisions
of $n$ apples into two sets and finding the one with the minimum difference in
weights. Here are two ways to do this.

#### Generating Subsets Recursively

The first method would be to write a recursive function which searches over all
possibilities.

At some index, we either add $\texttt{weight}_i$ to the first set or the second
set, storing two sums $s_1$ and $s_2$ with the sum of values in each set.

Then, we return the difference between the two sums once we've reached the end
of the array.

#### Generating Subsets with Bitmasks

<Warning>

You are not expected to know this for Bronze.

</Warning>

A **bitmask** is an integer whose binary representation is used to represent a
subset. For a particular bitmask, if the $i$'th bit is turned on (equal to $1$),
we say the $i$'th apple is in $s_1$. Then, the rest of the apples are in $s_2$.
We can iterate through all subsets $s_1$ if we check all bitmasks ranging from
$0$ to $2^N-1$. For each bitmask, find the sum of $s_1$ and $s_2$ and find the
minimum difference between their sums.

Note the fancy bitwise operations:

- `1 << x` for an integer $x$ is another way of writing $2^x$, which, in binary,
  has only the $x$'th bit turned on.
- The `&` (and) operator will take two integers and return a new integer.
  `a & b` for integers $a$ and $b$ will return a new integer whose $i$'th bit is
  turned on if and only if the $i$'th bit is turned on for both $a$ and $b$.
  Thus, `mask & (1 << x)` will return a positive value only if the $x$'th bit is
  turned on in $mask$.

## Permutations

A **permutation** is a reordering of a list of elements.

<FocusProblem problem="permSam" />

### Lexicographical Order

This term is mentioned quite frequently, ex. in
[USACO Bronze - Photoshoot](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=988).

<!-- <Problems problems={"ex"} /> -->

Think about how are words ordered in a dictionary. (In fact, this is where the
term "lexicographical" comes from.)

In dictionaries, you will see that words beginning with the letter `a` appears
at the very beginning, followed by words beginning with `b`, and so on. If two
words have the same starting letter, the second letter is used to compare them;
if both the first and second letters are the same, then use the third letter to
compare them, and so on until we either reach a letter that is different, or we
reach the end of some word (in this case, the shorter word goes first).

Permutations can be placed into lexicographical order in almost the same way. We
first group permutations by their first element; if the first element of two
permutations are equal, then we compare them by the second element; if the
second element is also equal, then we compare by the third element, and so on.

For example, the permutations of 3 elements, in lexicographical order, are

$$
[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
$$

Notice that the list starts with permutations beginning with 1 (just like a
dictionary that starts with words beginning with `a`), followed by those
beginning with 2 and those beginning with 3. Within the same starting element,
the second element is used to make comparisions.

Generally, unless you are specifically asked to find the lexicographically
smallest/largest solution, you do not need to worry about whether permutations
are being generated in lexicographical order. However, the idea of
lexicographical order does appear quite often in programming contest problems,
and in a variety of contexts, so it is strongly recommended that you familiarize
yourself with its definition.

Some problems will ask for an ordering of elements that satisfies certain
conditions. In these problems, if $N \leq 10$, we can just iterate through all
$N!=N\cdot (N-1)\cdot (N-2)\cdots 1$ permutations and check each permutation for
validity.

#### Generating Permutations Recursively

<!-- For a list of $N$ elements, there are  ways to permute them, and generally we'll need to read through each permutation once to check its validity, for a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot N!)$. -->

Just a slight modification of method 1 from CPH.

We'll use the recursive function $\texttt{search}$ to find all the permutations
of the string $s$. First, keep track of how many of each character there are in
$s$. For each function call, add an available character to the current string,
and call $\texttt{search}$ with that string. When the current string has the
same size as $s$, we've found a permutation and can add it to the list of
$\texttt{perms}$.

	}
	for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
	{
		// for all available characters
		if (char_count[i] > 0)
		{
			// add it to the current string and search
			char_count[i]--;
			search(curr + (char)('a' + i));
			char_count[i]++;
		}
	}

#### Generating Permutations Using [`next_permutation`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation)

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="Mark Nelson"
		title="Next Permutation"
		url="https://marknelson.us/posts/2002/03/01/next-permutation.html"
		starred
	>
		explanation with an example
	</Resource>
</Resources>

Alternatively, we can just use the `next_permutation()` function. This function
takes in a range and modifies it to the next greater permutation. If there is no
greater permutation, it returns false. To iterate through all permutations,
place it inside a `do-while` loop. We are using a `do-while` loop here instead
of a typical `while` loop because a `while` loop would modify the smallest
permutation before we got a chance to process it.

What's going to be in the `check` function depends on the problem, but it should
verify whether the current permutation satisfies the constraints given in the
problem.

```cpp
do {
	check(v); // process or check the current permutation for validity
} while(next_permutation(v.begin(), v.end()));
```

Each call to `next_permutation` makes a constant number of swaps on average if
we go through all $N!$ permutations of size $N$.

<Warning>

One small detail is that you need to sort the string before calling
`next_permutation()` because the method generates strings in lexicographical
order. If the string isn't sorted, then strings which are lexicographically
smaller than the initial string won't be generated.

</Warning>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	vector<string> perms;
	sort(s.begin(), s.end());
	do
	{
		perms.push_back(s);
	}
	while (next_permutation(s.begin(), s.end()));
	cout << perms.size() << endl;
	for (string perm : perms)
	{
		cout << perm << endl;
	}
}
```

<PySection>

#### Generating Permutations Using [`itertools.permutations`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations)

Since `itertools.permutations` treats elements as unique based on position, not
value, it returns all permutations, with repeats. Putting the returned tuples in
a set can filter out duplicates, and since tuples are returned, we need to join
the characters into a string.

```py
import itertools
s = input()
# perms is a sorted list of all the permutations of the given string
perms = sorted(set(itertools.permutations(s)))
print(len(perms))
for perm in perms:
	print("".join(perm))

### Solution - Chessboard & Queens

#### Using `next_permutation`

Since no two queens can be in the same column, let's generate a permutation of
length $8$. Then, the $p_i$ represents the column that the $i$-th queen goes on.

By generating all permutations, we can quickly test all possible placements, and
count how many are valid.

To make the implementation easier, we can observe that some bottom-left to
top-right diagonal can be represented as all squares $i, j$ such that
$i + j = S$ for some $S$. Similarly, some bottom-right to top-left diagonal can
be represented as $i + 7 - j$ if $i, j$ are zero-indexed.

#### Using Backtracking

According to CPH:

> A backtracking algorithm begins with an empty solution and extends the
> solution step by step. The search recursively goes through all different ways
> how a solution can be constructed.

Since the bounds are small, we can recursively backtrack over all ways to place
the queens, storing the current state of the board.

Then, we can try to place a queen at all squares $x, y$ if it isn't attacked by
a queen or blocked and recurse, before removing this queen and backtracking.

Finally, when we have placed all the queens and the board's state is valid, then
increment the answer.

## Problems

None of these require pruning.

<Problems problems="gen" />

You can find more problems at the CP2 link given above or at
[USACO Training](https://train.usaco.org/). However, these sorts of problems
appear much less frequently then they once did.

	  <Quiz.Question>
	    What is the time complexity of printing each element of all of the permutations of an array of length $n$?
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: Consider how many permutations there are in total
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: Remember that permutations and subsets are different
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $\mathcal{O}(n!)$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: It also takes time to generate the permutations and print each element of the permutation
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer correct>
	      $\mathcal{O}(n! \cdot n)$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Correct: Both recursion and $\texttt{next\_permutation}$ take $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and there are $n!$ permutations, so the total time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n! \cdot n)$
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	  </Quiz.Question>
	  <Quiz.Question>
	    For what size of $n$ could we expect a solution that runs through all of the subsets of an array of length $n$ under reasonable time constraints?
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $n \leq 10^9$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: There are $2^n$ subsets of $n$ numbers. $2^{10^9}$ has around 301030000 digits which would take well until the heat death of the universe to finish generating all the subsets!
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      $n \leq 10^4$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: $n = 10^4$ is still too large
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer correct>
	      $n \leq 22$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Correct: This is just about right: $2^{22} \approx 10^7$, which is a bit less than the number of computations that the grading server can run in a second (which is around $10^8$). 
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer correct>
	      $n \leq 10$
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Correct: It's definitely possible to run a $2^n$ solution for $n \leq 10$. However, we can go larger, up to around $n \leq 25$

	  <Quiz.Question>
	    Why are iterative methods of generating permutations and subsets like $\texttt{next\_permutation}$ and bitmasking preferable over recursive implementations?
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      Recursion often runs into the issue of stack size, which can cause unexpected runtime errors
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: A hallmark of problems featuring complete search with permutations/subsets is that $n$ is small, usually $\leq 20$. This means that recursion won't go particularly deep, and there won't be any issues with stack size. 
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer correct>
	      Iterative methods are easier to implement and are often faster and less buggy. 
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Correct: Having to code your own permutation/subset function can be inefficient in a timed contest environment. It's definitely worth learning iterative methods to save valuable time on debugging. 
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer>
	      Recursion is so slow that it will often cause Time Limit Exceeded even for small arrays and should be avoided at all costs. 
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: Although recursion is slowing than iterative methods, it's still fast enough to pass most problems

	  </Quiz.Question>
	  <Quiz.Question>
	    The following code is meant to generate all subsets of a given array:
		```cpp
		int A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

		void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
			if (i == 5) {
				for (int x : subset)
					cout << x << ' ';
				cout << '\n';
			}

			subset.push_back(A[i]);
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
			subset.pop_back();
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
		}
		```
	    There is an error with this code that causes it to crash. What does the corrected code look like?
	    <Quiz.Answer>
		```cpp
		void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
			if (i == 5) {
				for (int x : subset)
					cout << x << ' ';
				cout << '\n';
			}

			// must always go to empty subset first
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
			subset.push_back(A[i]);
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
		}
		```
		<Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: This is another way of generating subsets, but it's not the error!
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer>
		```cpp
		void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
			if (i == 4) { // incorrect ending index
				for (int x : subset)
					cout << x << ' ';
				cout << '\n';
			}

			subset.push_back(A[i]);
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
			subset.pop_back();
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
		}
		```

	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Incorrect: This doesn't stop the error and prevents us from adding the last number to any subset
	      </Quiz.Explanation>
	    </Quiz.Answer>
	    <Quiz.Answer correct>
		```cpp
		void generateSubsets(int i, vector<int> &subset) {
			if (i == 5) {
				for (int x : subset)
					cout << x << ' ';
				cout << '\n';
				return; // missing return statement
			}

			subset.push_back(A[i]);
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
			subset.pop_back();
			generateSubsets(i + 1, subset);
		}
		```
	      <Quiz.Explanation>
		Correct: After we finish printing (or checking) the subset, remember to always return immediately. Otherwise, it causes nasty errors that often crashes the program.
