Python has built-in sets and maps, however they do _not_ store elements in
sorted order.

</LanguageSection>

## Sets

<FocusProblem problem="dis" />

A **set** is a collection of elements that contains no duplicates.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

### Unordered Sets

In _unordered_ sets, elements are stored in an arbitrary order through hashing.
Insertions, deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (with a high
constant factor). Unordered sets are implemented by
[`std:unordered_set`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/)
in the `<unordered_set>` header.

Some operations on an `std::unordered_set` named `s` include:

- `s.insert(x)`, which adds the element `x` to `s` if not already present.
- `s.erase(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `s` if present.
- `s.count(x)`, which returns `1` if `s` contains `x` and `0` if it doesn't.

Unordered sets work with primitive types, but require a
[custom hash function](/gold/unordered-map#custom-hashing)
for structures/classes like vectors and pairs.

```cpp
unordered_set<int> s;
s.insert(1);  // {1}
s.insert(4);  // {1, 4}
s.insert(2);  // {1, 4, 2}
s.insert(1);  // does nothing because 1's already in the set
cout << s.count(1) << endl;  // 1
s.erase(1);  // {2, 4}
cout << s.count(5) << endl;  // 0
s.erase(0);  // does nothing because 0 wasn't in the set
```

### Sorted Sets

In _sorted_ sets, the elements are sorted in order of element. Insertions,
deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number
of elements in the set. Sorted sets are implemented by
[`std:set`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) in the `<set>` header.

`std::set` includes all the essential operations that `std::unordered_set` has
(including insertion, deletion, searches, etc.), but also some additional ones.
Refer to the
[More Operations on Sorted Sets](/silver/intro-sorted-sets)
module for more detail.

You can iterate through a set in sorted order using a for-each loop.

```cpp
set<int> s;
s.insert(1);  // [1]
s.insert(4);  // [1, 4]
s.insert(2);  // [1, 2, 4]

// Outputs 1, 2, and 4 on separate lines
for (int element : s) {
	cout << element << endl;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

### Unordered Sets

In _unordered_ sets, elements are stored in an arbitrary order. Insertions,
deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (with a high constant factor).
Unordered sets are implemented in Java by the
[`HashSet`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html)
class (which comes from the `java.util` library).

Some operations on a `HashSet` named `set` include:

- `set.add(x)`, which adds the element `x` to `set` if not already present.
- `set.remove(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `set` if present.
- `set.contains(x)`, which checks whether `set` contains the element `x`.

Unordered sets work with primitive types and their object wrappers, but require
a [custom hash function](/gold/unordered-map#custom-hashing)
for custom classes.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(1);  // {1}
set.add(4);  // {1, 4}
set.add(2);  // {1, 4, 2}
set.add(1);  // {1, 4, 2}
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
System.out.println(set.contains(1));  // true
set.remove(1);  // {4, 2}
System.out.println(set.contains(5));  // false
set.remove(0);  // does nothing because 0 wasn't in the set
```

### Sorted Sets

In _sorted_ sets, the elements are stored in order. Insertions, deletions, and
searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements in
the set. Sorted sets are implemented in Java by the `TreeSet` class.

`TreeSet` includes all the operations that `HashSet` has, but also includes some
additional ones. Refer to the
[More Operations on Sorted Sets](/silver/intro-sorted-sets)
module for more detail.

You can iterate through a `TreeSet` in sorted order using a for-each loop.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
set.add(1);  // {1}
set.add(4);  // {1, 4}
set.add(2);  // {1, 2, 4}

// Outputs 1, 2, and 4 on separate lines
for (int element : set) {
	System.out.println(element);
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Python's built-in `set` uses hashing to support $\mathcal{O}(1)$ insertion,
deletion, and searches. Some operations on a Python `set` named `s` include:

- `s.add(x)`: adds element `x` to `s` if not already present
- `s.remove(x)`: removes an element `x` from `set` if present
- `x in s`: checks whether `s` contains the element `x`

```py
s = set()
s.add(1) # {1}
s.add(4) # {1, 4}
s.add(2) # {1, 4, 2}
s.add(1) # {1, 4, 2}
# the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
print(1 in s) # True
s.remove(1) # {4, 2}
print(5 in s) # False
s.remove(0) # {4, 2}
# if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens
```

### Solution - Distinct Numbers

This problem asks us to calculate the number of distinct values in a given list.

#### Method 1 - Set

This is probably the easier of the two methods, but requires knowledge of sets.
Because sets only store one copy of each value, we can insert all the numbers
into a set, and then print out the size of the set.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	set<int> distinctNumbers;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int number; cin >> number;
		distinctNumbers.insert(number);
	}

	cout << distinctNumbers.size() << endl;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
// Source: Daniel

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class DistinctNumbers {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();
		int n = io.nextInt();
		Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			set.add(io.nextInt());
		}
		io.println(set.size());
		io.close();
	}

	// CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
n = int(input())  # unused
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
distinct_nums = set(nums)
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

We can do this more efficiently by skipping the creation of the list, and use a
set comprehension directly:

```py
n = int(input())  # unused
distinct_nums = {int(x) for x in input().split()}
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

#### Method 2 - Sorting

Check out the [solution](/solutions/cses-1621) involving sorting.

## Maps

<FocusProblem problem="ex" />

A **map** is a set of entries, each consisting of a **key** and a **value**. In
a map, all keys are required to be unique, but values can be repeated. Maps have
three primary methods:

- one to add a specified key-value pairing
- one to retrieve the value for a given key
- one to remove a key-value pairing from the map

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In _sorted_ maps, the pairs are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions,
and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of pairs in
the map. In _unordered_ maps, the pairs aren't kept in sorted order and all
insertions, deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Sorted maps are
implemented with `std::map` and unordered maps are implemented with
`std::unordered_map`.

Some operations on an `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` named `m` include:

- `m[key]`, which returns a reference to the value associated with the key
  `key`.
  - If `key` is not present in the map, then the value associated with `key` is
    constructed using the default constructor of the value type. For example, if
    the value type is `int`, then calling `m[key]` for a key not within the map
    sets the value associated with that key to `0`. As another example, if the
    value type is `std::string`, then calling `m[key]` for a key not within the
    map sets the value associated with that key to the empty string. More
    discussion regarding what happens in this case can be found
    [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10124679/what-happens-if-i-read-a-maps-value-where-the-key-does-not-exist).
  - Alternatively, `m.at(key)` behaves the same as `m[key]` if `key` is
    contained within `m` but throws an exception otherwise.
  - `m[key] = value` will assign the value `value` to the key `key`.
- `m.count(key)`, which returns the number of times the key is in the map
  (either one or zero), and therefore checks whether a key exists in the map.
- `m.erase(key)`, which removes the map entry associated with the specified key
  if the key was present in the map.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
m[1] = 5;  // [(1, 5)]
m[3] = 14;  // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
m[2] = 7;  // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m[0] = -1;  // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m.erase(2);  // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (3, 14)]
cout << m[1] << endl;  // 5
cout << m.count(7) << endl;  // 0
cout << m.count(1) << endl;  // 1
cout << m[2] << endl;  // 0
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In _sorted_ maps, the pairs are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions,
and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of pairs in
the map.

In _unordered_ maps, the pairs aren't kept in sorted order and all insertions,
deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Sorted maps are implemented
with `TreeMap` and unordered maps are implemented with `HashMap`.

In both `TreeMap` and `HashMap`, the `put(key, value)` method assigns a value to
a key and places the key and value pair into the map. The `get(key)` method
returns the value associated with the key. The `containsKey(key)` method checks
whether a key exists in the map. Lastly, `remove(key)` removes the map entry
associated with the specified key.

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();
map.put(1, 5);  // [(1, 5)]
map.put(3, 14);  // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
map.put(2, 7);  // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
map.remove(2);  // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
System.out.println(map.get(1));  // 5
System.out.println(map.containsKey(7));  // false
System.out.println(map.containsKey(1));  // true
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Colloquially, maps are referred to as **dicts** in python. They act as hash
maps, so they have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ insertion, deletion, and searches.

```py
d = {}
d[1] = 5  # {1: 5}
d[3] = 14  # {1: 5, 3: 14}
d[2] = 7  # {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 14}
del d[2]  # {1: 5, 3: 14}
print(d[1])  # 5
print(7 in d)  # False
print(1 in d)  # True
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

### Iterating Over Maps

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

An `std::map` stores entries as [pairs](/bronze/intro-ds#pairs--tuples) in the
form `{key, value}`. To iterate over maps, you can use a `for` loop. The `auto`
keyword suffices to iterate over any type of pair (here, `auto` substitutes for
`pair<const int, int>`).

```cpp
for (const auto& x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
}
for (auto x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
}

/* both output the following:
0 -1
1 5
3 14
*/
```

The first method (iterating over const references) is generally preferred over
the second because the second will make a copy of each element that it iterates
over. Additionally, you can pass by reference when iterating over a map,
allowing you to modify the values (but not the keys) of the pairs stored in the
map:

```cpp
for (auto& x : m) {
	x.second = 3;
}
for (pair<int,int> x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
}

/*
0 3
1 3
3 3
*/
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

To iterate over maps, you can use a for-each loop over the keys:

```java
for (int k : m.keySet()) {
	System.out.println(k + " " + m.get(k));
}
```

You can also use a for-each loop over the entries:

```java
for (Map.Entry entry : m.entrySet()) {
	System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

To iterate over `dict`s, there are three options. Dicts will be returned in the
same order of insertion in
[Python 3.6+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/are-dictionaries-ordered-in-python-3-6).
You can iterate over the keys:

```py
for key in d:
	print(key)
```

You can iterate over the values:

```py
for value in d.values():
	print(value)
```

You can iterate over the key-value pairs:

```py
for key, value in d.items():
	print(key, value)
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

While you are free to change the _values_ in a map when iterating over it (as
demonstrated above), it is generally a bad idea to insert or remove elements of
a map while iterating over it.

<LanguageSection>
<PySection>

For example, the following code attempts to remove every entry from a map, but
results in a runtime error.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}

for i in d:
	del d[i]
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 3, in <module>
    for i in d:
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

One way is to get around this is to create a new map.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}

# only includes every third element
d_new = dict(item for i, item in enumerate(d.items()) if i % 3 == 0)

print("new dict:", d_new)  # new dict: {0: 0, 3: 3, 6: 6, 9: 9}
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to remove and remove them
after the iteration finishes:

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}

# removes every third element
to_remove = {key for i, key in enumerate(d) if i % 3 == 0}

for key in to_remove:
	del d[key]

print("new dict:", d)  # new dict: {1: 1, 2: 2, 4: 4, 5: 5, 7: 7, 8: 8}
```

</PySection>
<CPPSection>

For example, the following code attempts to remove every entry from a map, but
results in a segmentation fault.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	m[i] = i;

for (auto &it : m) {
	cout << "Current Key: " << it.first << endl;

	m.erase(it.first);
}
```

The reason is due to "iterators, pointers and references referring to elements
removed by the function [being] invalidated" (as stated in the documentation for
[`erase`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/erase/)), though iterators
are beyond the scope of this module.

One way to get around this is to just create a new map instead of removing from
the old one.

```cpp
map<int, int> m, M;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	m[i] = i;

int current_iteration = 0;

for (const auto &it : m) {
	// only includes every third element
	if (current_iteration % 3 == 0) {
		M[it.first] = it.second;
	}

	current_iteration++;
}

swap(m, M);

cout << "Entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m) {
	cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;
}
/*
 * Entries:
 * 0 0
 * 3 3
 * 6 6
 * 9 9
 */
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to erase and erase them
after the iteration finishes.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
	m[i] = i;
}

vector<int> to_erase;
int current_iteration = 0;

for (const auto &it : m) {
	// removes every third element
	if (current_iteration % 3 == 0) {
		to_erase.push_back(it.first);
	}

	current_iteration++;
}

for (int key : to_erase) {
	m.erase(key);
}

cout << "Remaining entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m) {
	cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;
}

/*
 * Remaining entries:
 * 1 1
 * 2 2
 * 4 4
 * 5 5
 * 7 7
 * 8 8
 */
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Modifying a Collection (`Set`, `Map`, etc.) in the middle of a for-each loop
will cause a
[ConcurrentModificationException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html).
See the following snippet for an example:

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
// m starts as {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
m.put(0, 0); m.put(1, 1); m.put(2, 2);

for (int key : m.keySet()) {
	m.remove(key);  // ConcurrentModificationException thrown!!
}
```

One work-around is to use `Iterator` and the `.remove()` method to remove
elements while looping over them, like in the next code snippet:

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
// m starts as {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
m.put(0, 0); m.put(1, 1); m.put(2, 2);

Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> iter = m.entrySet().iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()) {
	int key = iter.next().getKey();
	if (key == 0 || key == 2) {
		iter.remove();
	}
}

// m ends as {1: 1}
System.out.println("Remaining Entries:");
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : m.entrySet()) {
	System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
}
```

However, `Iterator` is outside the scope of this module.

The easiest option (in most cases) if you want to remove/insert mutiple entries
at once is to use your Container's `.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` methods. That
means that you should put all the elements you want to remove (or add) in a new
Collection, and then use that new Collection as the parameter of the
`.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` method that you call on your original
Collection. See the following code snippet for an example (it works equivalently
to the code above):

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
// m starts as {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
m.put(0, 0); m.put(1, 1); m.put(2, 2);

Set<Integer> keysToRemove = new TreeSet<>();
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : m.entrySet()) {
	int key = entry.getKey();
	if (key == 0 || key == 2) {
		keysToRemove.add(key);
	}
}

// removes all entries with key in keysToRemove
m.keySet().removeAll(keysToRemove);

// m ends as {1: 1}
System.out.println("Remaining Entries:");
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : m.entrySet()) {
	System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
}
```

## Problems

Some of these problems can be solved by sorting alone, though sets or maps could
make their implementation easier.
