## Binomial Coefficients

<FocusProblem problem="sample" />

The **binomial coefficient** $\binom{n}{k}$ (pronounced as "$n$ choose $k$" or sometimes written as ${}_nC_k$) represents the number of ways to choose a subset of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. For example, $\binom{4}{2} = 6$, because the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ has $6$ subsets of $2$ elements: 

$$
\{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{3, 4\}
$$

There are two ways to calculate binomial coefficients:

### Method 1: Pascal's Triangle (Dynamic Programming) - $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

Binomial coefficients can be recursively calculated as follows:

$$
    \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} + \binom{n - 1}{k}
$$

The intuition behind this is to fix an element $x$ in the set and choose $k − 1$ elements from $n − 1$ elements if $x$ is included in the set or choose $k$ elements from $n − 1$ elements, otherwise. 

The base cases for the recursion are:

$$
	\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n}  = 1
$$

because there is always exactly one way to construct an empty subset and a subset that contains all the elements.

This recursive formula is commonly known as [Pascal's Triangle](https://brilliant.org/wiki/pascals-triangle/). 

A naive implementation of this would use a recursive formula, like below:

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>


```cpp
/** Computes nCr mod p using naive recursion */
int binomial(int n, int k, int p) {
	if (k == 0 || k == n) {
		return 1;
	}
	return (binomial(n - 1, k - 1, p) + binomial(n - 1, k, p)) % p;
}
```
</CPPSection>
</LanguageSection>
	
Additionally, we can optimize this from $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ using [dynamic programming](/gold/intro-dp) (DP) by caching the values of smaller binomials to prevent recalculating the same values over and over again. The code below shows a bottom-up implementation of this.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
/** Computes nCr mod p using dynamic programming */
int binomial(int n, int k, int p) {
	// dp[i][j] stores iCj
	vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int> (k + 1, 0));
	
	// base cases described above
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
		/*
		 * i choose 0 is always 1 since there is exactly one way 
		 * to choose 0 elements from a set of i elements 
		 * (don't choose anything)
		 */
		dp[i][0] = 1;
		/*
		 * i choose i is always 1 since there is exactly one way 
		 * to choose i elements from a set of i elements
		 * (choose every element in the set)
		 */
		if (k <= i) {
			dp[i][i] = 1; 
		}
	}
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
		for (int j = 1; j <= min(i, k); j++) {
			if (i != j) {  // skips over the base cases
				// uses the recurrence relation above
				dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]) % p;
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[n][k];  // returns nCk modulo p
}
```
</CPPSection>
</LanguageSection>

### Method 2: Factorial Definition (Modular Inverses) - $\mathcal{O}(n\log MOD)$

Define $n!$ as $n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \ldots 1$. $n!$ represents the number of permutations of a set of $n$ elements. See [this AoPS Article](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Factorial) for more details.

Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:

$$
	\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

Recall that $\binom{n}{k}$ also represents the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. One strategy to get all such combinations is to go through all possible permutations of the $n$ elements, and only pick the first $k$ elements out of each permutation. There are $n!$ ways to do so. However, note the the order of the elements inside and outside the subset does not matter, so the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n − k)!$

Since these binomial coefficients are large, problems typically require us to output the answer modulo a large prime $p$ such as $10^9 + 7$.

Fortunately, we can use [modular inverses](/gold/modular) to divide $n!$ by $k!$ and $(n - k)!$ modulo $p$ for any prime $p$. In our case, $MOD = 10^9+7$ is prime, so we can utilize [modular inverses](/gold/modular). However, computing inverse factorials **online** can be very time costly. Instead, we can **precompute** all factorials in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and inverse factorials in $\mathcal{O}(n\log MOD)$ by taking the inverses of each factorial. See the code below for the implementation.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
const int MAXN = 1e6;

long long fac[MAXN + 1], inv[MAXN + 1];
		
/** Computes x^y modulo p in O(log p) time. */
long long exp(long long x, long long y, long long p) {
	long long res = 1; x %= p;
	while (y) {
		if (y & 1) {
			res *= x; res %= p; 
		}
		x *= x; x %= p;
		y >>= 1;
	}
	return res;
}

/** Precomputes n! from 0 to MAXN. */
void factorial(long long p) {
	fac[0] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % p;
	}
}

/** Precomputes all modular inverse factorials from 0 to MAXN in O(n log p) time */
void inverses(long long p) {
	inv[0] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		inv[i] = exp(fac[i], p - 2, p);
	}
}
		
/** Computes nCr mod p */
long long choose(long long n, long long r, long long p) {
	return fac[n] * inv[r] % p * inv[n - r] % p;
}
```
</CPPSection>
</LanguageSection>

### Solution - Binomial Coefficients

The first method for calculating binomial factorials is too slow for this problem since the constraints on $a$ and $b$ are $(1 \leq b \leq a \leq 10^6)$ (recall that the first implementation runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time complexity). However, we can use the second method to answer each of the $n$ queries in constant time by precomputing factorials and their modular inverses.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const int MAXN = 1e6;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

ll fac[MAXN + 1];
ll inv[MAXN + 1];

//BeginCodeSnip{Counting functions}
ll exp(ll x, ll y, ll p) {
	ll res = 1; x %= p;
	while (y) {
		if (y & 1) {
			res *= x; res %= p; 
		}
		x *= x;
		x %= p;
		y >>= 1;
	}
	return res;
}

void factorial() {
	fac[0] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % MOD;
	}
}

void inverses() {
	inv[0] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		inv[i] = exp(fac[i], MOD - 2, MOD);
	}
}

ll choose(int n, int r) {
	return fac[n] * inv[r] % MOD * inv[n - r] % MOD;
}
//EndCodeSnip

int main() {
	factorial();
	inverses();
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int a, b;
		cin >> a >> b;
		cout << choose(a, b) << '\n';
	}
}
```
