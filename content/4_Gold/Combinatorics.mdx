## Binomial Coefficients

<FocusProblem problem="sample" />

The **binomial coefficient** $\binom{n}{k}$ (pronounced  as "$n$ choose $k$" or commonly written as $n C_k$) represents the number of ways to choose a subset of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. For example, $\binom{4}{2} = 6$, because the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ has $6$ subsets of $2$ elements: 

$$
\{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{3, 4\}
$$

There are two ways to calculate binomial coefficients:

### Method 1: Pascal's Triangle (Dynamic Programming) - $O(N^2)$

Binomial coefficients can be recursively calculated as follows:

$$
    \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} + \binom{n - 1}{k}
$$

The intuition behind this is to fix an element $x$ in the set and choose $k − 1$ elements from $n − 1$ elements if $x$ is included in the set or choose $k$ elements from $n − 1$ elements, otherwise. 

The base cases for the recursion are:

$$
	\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n}  = 1
$$

because there is always exactly one way to construct an empty subset and a subset that contains all the elements.

This recursive formula is commonly known as the [Pascal's Triangle](https://brilliant.org/wiki/pascals-triangle/). 

Additionally, we can optimize this recursion formula from $O(2^n)$ to $O(n^2)$ using [Dynamic Programming](https://usaco.guide/gold/intro-dp?lang=cpp). You can learn more about how DP is used to optimize the binomial coefficient recursive formula [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binomial-coefficient-dp-9/).

```cpp
const int MAXN = 1000, MAXK = 1000, MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int dp[MAXN + 1][MAXK + 1];

int binomial(int n, int k) {
	/*
	 * stores each iCj for each i from 1 to n 
	 * and each j from 1 to k
	 */
	// base cases described above
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
		/*
		 * i choose 0 is always 1 since there is exactly one way 
		 * to choose 0 elements from a set of i elements 
		 * (don't choose anything)
		 */
		dp[i][0] = 1;
		/*
		 * i choose i is always 1 since there is exactly one way 
		 * to choose i elements from a set of i elements
		 * (choose every element in the set)
		 */
		if (k <= i) {
			dp[i][i] = 1; 
		}
	}
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
		for (int j = 1; j <= min(i, k); j++) {
			if (i != j) { // skips over the base cases
				// uses the recurrence relation above
				dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[n][k]; // returns nCk
}
```

### Method 2: Factorial Definition (Modular Inverses) - $O(n\log n)$

First of all, we define $n!$ as $n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \ldots 1$, which represents the number of permutations of a set of $n$ elements.

Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:

$$
	\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

Since there are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements, we go through all permutations and always include the first $k$ elements of the permutation in the subset. The order of the elements inside and outside the subset does not matter, so the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n − k)!$

Since these binomial coefficients are large, problems typically require us to output the answer modulo a large prime $p$ such as $10^9 + 7$.

Fortunately, we can use [modular inverses](https://usaco.guide/gold/modular?lang=cpp) to divide $n!$ by $k!$ and $(n - k)!$ modulo $p$. We can precompute all factorials in $O(n)$ time and inverse factorials in $O(n \log n)$.

```cpp
const int MAXN = 1e6;

long long fac[MAXN + 1], inv[MAXN + 1];

long long exp(ll x, ll y, ll p) {
	long long res = 1; x %= p;
	while(y) {
		if(y & 1) {
			res *= x; res %= p; 
		}
		x *= x; x %= p;
		y >>= 1;
	}
	return res;
}

void factorial(long long p) {
	fac[0] = 1;
	for(int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % p;
	}
}

void inverses(long long p) {
	inv[0] = 1;
	for(int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		inv[i] = exp(fac[i], p - 2, p);
	}
}

long long choose(long long n, long long r, long long p) {
	return (fac[n] * inv[r] % p * inv[n - r] % p);
}
```

### Solution - Binomial Coefficients

The first method for calculating binomial factorials is too slow for this problem since the constraints on $a$ and $b$ are $(1 \leq b \leq a \leq 10^6)$. However, we can use the second method to answer each of the $n$ queries in $O(1)$ time by precomputing factorials and modular inverses.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const int MAXN = 1e6, MOD = 1e9 + 7;

ll fac[MAXN + 1], inv[MAXN + 1];

ll exp(ll x, ll y, ll p) {
	ll res = 1; x %= p;
	while(y) {
		if(y & 1) {
			res *= x; res %= p; 
		}
		x *= x;
		x %= p;
		y >>= 1;
	}
	return res;
}

void factorial() {
	fac[0] = 1;
	for(int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % MOD;
	}
}

void inverses() {
	inv[0] = 1;
	for(int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
		inv[i] = exp(fac[i], MOD - 2, MOD);
	}
}

ll choose(int n, int r) {
	return (fac[n] * inv[r] % MOD * inv[n - r] % MOD);
}

int main() {
	factorial(); inverses();
	int n; cin >> n;
	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
		cout << choose(a, b) << endl;
	}
}
