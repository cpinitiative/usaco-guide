Digit DP is a technique used to solve problems that asks you to find the number
of integers within a range that satisfies some property based on the digits of
the integers. Typically, the ranges are between large integers (such as between
$1$ to $10^{18}$), so looping through each integer and checking if it satisfies
the given property is too slow. Digit DP uses the digits of the integers to
quickly count the number of integers with the given property in the range of
integers.

## Solution - Odometer

### Without Dynamic Programming

We can solve this problem in $\mathcal{O}(Y - X)$ time by looping through $X
\ldots Y$ and checking whether a given number is an interesting number. However,
since $Y - X$ can be large, the naive solution is too slow, requiring us to
optimize it.

### With Dynamic Programming

One way to optimize the brute force approach of looping from $X$ to $Y$ and
counting interesting numbers is by using dynamic programming. The DP approach
involves considering all 9 digits one at a time to occupy at least half of the
number.

Let $\texttt{dp[pos][k][under][started]}$ where $\texttt{pos}$ is the current
position, $\texttt{k}$ is a counter to see if you have at least half of the same
digit, $\texttt{under}$ is whether you have gone below the actual number, and
$\texttt{started}$ is a boolean if you still have leading zeros. The transition
involves looping through 9 digits to add to the current location and comparing
with the digit we want to occupy at least half of the number.

Given the current state $\texttt{dp[pos][k][under][started]}$, we loop through
all digits from 0 to 9 and consider adding each of them to the current position.
If we add the digit $d$ to the current position, we update our state as follows:

* If $d$ is less than the $i$-th digit of the actual number $Y$, then we set
  $und$ to true.
* If $d$ is zero and we have a leading zero, then we set $is0$ to true.
* If $d$ is equal to the digit we are interested in, then we increment $k$.
* If $k$ is greater than $\lfloor \frac{i+1}{2} \rfloor$, then we increment our
  count of interesting numbers by 1.
* We move on to the next position by setting $i$ to $i+1$ and transitioning to
  the next state.

This algorithm is fast enough as the number of digits is small and there are
only nine digits.
