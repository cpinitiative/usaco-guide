## Prime Factorization

<FocusProblem problem="sample" />

A positive integer $a$ is called a **divisor** or a **factor** of a non-negative
integer $b$ if $b$ is divisible by $a$, which means that there exists some
integer $k$ such that $b = ka$. An integer $n > 1$ is **prime** if its only
divisors are $1$ and $n$. Integers greater than $1$ that are not prime are
**composite**.

Every positive integer has a unique **prime factorization**: a way of
decomposing it into a product of primes, as follows:

$$
n = {p_1}^{a_1} {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}
$$

where the $p_i$ are distinct primes and the $a_i$ are positive integers.

Now, we will discuss how to find the prime factorization of any positive
integer.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
vector<int> factor(int n) {
	vector<int> ret;
	for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
		while (n % i == 0) {
			ret.push_back(i);
			n /= i;
		}
	}
	if (n > 1) ret.push_back(n);
	return ret;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
ArrayList<Integer> factor(int n) {
	ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
	for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
		while (n % i == 0) {
			factors.add(i);
			n /= i;
		}
	}
	if (n > 1) factors.add(n);
	return factors;
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
def factor(n):
	ret = []
	i = 2
	while i * i <= n:
		while n % i == 0:
			ret.append(i)
			n //= i
		i += 1
	if n > 1:
		ret.append(n)
	return ret
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

This algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ time, because the for loop checks
divisibility for at most $\sqrt{n}$ values. Even though there is a while loop
inside the for loop, dividing $n$ by $i$ quickly reduces the value of $n$, which
means that the outer for loop runs less iterations, which actually speeds up the
code.

Let's look at an example of how this algorithm works, for $n = 252$.

<center>

| $i$ | $n$   | $v$              |
| --- | ----- | ---------------- |
| $2$ | $252$ | $\{\}$           |
| $2$ | $126$ | $\{2\}$          |
| $2$ | $63$  | $\{2, 2\}$       |
| $3$ | $21$  | $\{2, 2, 3\}$    |
| $3$ | $7$   | $\{2, 2, 3, 3\}$ |

</center>

At this point, the for loop terminates, because $i$ is already 3 which is
greater than $\lfloor \sqrt{7} \rfloor$. In the last step, we add $7$ to the
list of factors $v$, because it otherwise won't be added, for a final prime
factorization of $\{2, 2, 3, 3, 7\}$.

### Solution - Counting Divisors

The most straightforward solution is just to do what the problem asks us to do -
for each $x$, find the number of divisors of $x$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt x)$ time.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	for (int q = 0; q < n; q++) {
		int x;
		int div_num = 0;
		cin >> x;
		for (int i = 1; i * i <= x; i++) {
			if (x % i == 0) {
				div_num += i * i == x ? 1 : 2;
			}
		}
		cout << div_num << '\n';
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Divisors {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int queryNum = Integer.parseInt(read.readLine());
		StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
		for (int q = 0; q < queryNum; q++) {
			int n = Integer.parseInt(read.readLine());
			int divisors = 0;
			for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
				if (n % i == 0) {
					divisors += i * i == n ? 1 : 2;
				}
			}
			ans.append(divisors).append('\n');
		}
		System.out.print(ans);
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>


</LanguageSection>

This solution runs in $\mathcal{O}(n \sqrt x)$ time, which is just fast enough
to get AC. However, we can actually speed this up to get an
$\mathcal{O}((x + n) \log x)$ solution!

First, let's discuss an important property of the prime factorization. Consider:

$$
x = {p_1}^{a_1} {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}
$$

Then the number of divisors of $x$ is simply
$(a_1 + 1) \cdot (a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1)$.

Why is this true? The exponent of $p_i$ in any divisor of $x$ must be in the
range $[0, a_i]$ and each different exponent results in a different set of
divisors, so each $p_i$ contributes $a_i + 1$ to the product.

$x$ can have $\mathcal{O}(\log x)$ distinct prime factors, so if we can find the
prime factorization of $x$ efficiently, we can answer queries in
$\mathcal{O}(\log x)$ time instead of the previous $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt x)$ time.

Here's how we find the prime factorization of $x$ in $\mathcal{O}(\log x)$ time
with $\mathcal{O}(x \log x)$ preprocessing:

- For each $k \leq 10^6$, find any prime number that divides $k$.
  - We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find this efficiently.
- For each $x$, we can then find the prime factorization by repeatedly dividing
  $x$ by a prime number that divides $x$ until $x = 1$.

Alternatively, we can slightly modify the the prime factorization code above.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 1e6;
// max_div[i] contains the largest prime that goes into i
int max_div[MAX_N + 1];

int main() {
	for (int i = 2; i <= MAX_N; i++) {
		if (max_div[i] == 0) {
			for (int j = i; j <= MAX_N; j += i) {
				max_div[j] = i;
			}
		}
	}

	int n;
	cin >> n;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int x;

		int div_num = 1;
		while (x != 1) {
			/*
			 * get the largest prime that can divide x and see
			 * how many times it goes into x (stored in count)
			 */
			int prime = max_div[x];
			int count = 0;
			while (x % prime == 0) {
				count++;
				x /= prime;
			}
			div_num *= count + 1;
		}
		cout << div_num << '\n';
	}

## GCD & LCM

### GCD

The **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the largest
integer that is a factor of both $a$ and $b$. In order to find the GCD of two
_non-negative_ integers, we use the **Euclidean Algorithm**, which is as
follows:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = \begin{cases}
	 a & b = 0 \\
	 \gcd(b, a \bmod b) & b \neq 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$

This algorithm is very easy to implement using a recursive function, as follows:

<LanguageSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
public int gcd(int a, int b) {
	return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

</JavaSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
	return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

For C++14, you can use the built-in `__gcd(a,b)`.

In C++17, there exists [`std::gcd`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd)
and [`std::lcm`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/lcm) in the
[`<numeric>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/numeric) header, so there's no
need to code your own GCD and LCM if you're using that.

</CPPSection>

<PySection>

```py
def gcd(a, b):
	return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

This function runs in $\mathcal{O}(\log ab)$ time because
$a\le b \implies b\pmod a <\frac{b}{2}$.

The worst-case scenario for the Euclidean algorithm is when $a$ and $b$ are
consecutive Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ and $F_{n + 1}$. for an explanation). In
this case, the algorithm will calculate
$\gcd(F_n, F_{n + 1}) = \gcd(F_{n - 1}, F_n) = \dots = \gcd(0, F_1)$. This means
that finding $\gcd(F_n, F_{n + 1})$ takes $n + 1$ steps, which is proportional
to $\log \left(F_n F_{n+1}\right)$.

<!-- (See [this Math Stack Exchange answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2477328/why-are-fibonacci-numbers-bad-for-euclids-algorithm-and-how-to-derive-this-uppe) -->
<!-- ^ this doesn't seem very helpful -->
<!-- Since $F_n = O(\varphi^n)$, the worst-case complexity of this algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\log ab)$. -->

### LCM

The **least common multiple (LCM)** of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the smallest
integer divisible by both $a$ and $b$. The LCM can easily be calculated from the
following property with the GCD:

$$
\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)}=\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\cdot b.
$$

<Warning>

Coding $\text{lcm}$ as `a * b / gcd(a, b)` might cause integer overflow if the
value of `a * b` is greater than the max size of the data type of `a * b` (e.g.
the max size of `int` is around 2 billion). Dividng `a` by `gcd(a, b)` first,
then multiplying it by `b` will prevent integer overflow if the result fits in
an `int`.

</Warning>

If we want to take the GCD or LCM of more than two elements, we can do so two at
a time, in any order. For example,

$$
\gcd(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = \gcd(a_1, \gcd(a_2, \gcd(a_3, a_4))).
$$

## Problems

<Problems problems="general" />

<!--
<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

**Exercise:** What's wrong with the following code?

```cpp
ll gcd(ll a, ll b){ return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b,a%b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return a/gcd(a,b)*b; }
int main() { cout << lcm(1000000000,999999999); } // output: 1808348672
```

<Spoiler title="Solution">

The code outputs the correct result (`999999999000000000`) for C++14 and
earlier. However, C++17 has built in `gcd(a,b)` and `lcm(a,b)` ...
