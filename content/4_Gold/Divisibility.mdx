## Prime Factorization

A positive integer $a$ is called a **divisor** or a **factor** of a non-negative
integer $b$ if $b$ is divisible by $a$, which means that there exists some
integer $k$ such that $b = ka$. An integer $n > 1$ is **prime** if its only
divisors are $1$ and $n$. Integers greater than $1$ that are not prime are
**composite**.

Every positive integer has a unique **prime factorization**: a way of
decomposing it into a product of primes, as follows:

$$
n = {p_1}^{a_1} {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}
$$

where the $p_i$ are distinct primes and the $a_i$ are positive integers.

Now, we will discuss how to find the prime factorization of any positive
integer.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
vector<int> factor(int n) {
	vector<int> ret;
	for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
		while (n % i == 0) {
			ret.push_back(i);
			n /= i;
		}
	}
	if (n > 1) { ret.push_back(n); }
	return ret;
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
List<Integer> factor(int n) {
	List<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
	for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
		while (n % i == 0) {
			factors.add(i);
			n /= i;
		}
	}
	if (n > 1) { factors.add(n); }
	return factors;
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

```py
from typing import List


def factor(n: int) -> List[int]:
	ret = []
	i = 2
	while i * i <= n:
		while n % i == 0:
			ret.append(i)
			n //= i
		i += 1
	if n > 1:
		ret.append(n)
	return ret
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

This algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ time, because the for loop checks
divisibility for at most $\sqrt{n}$ values. Even though there is a while loop
inside the for loop, dividing $n$ by $i$ quickly reduces the value of $n$, which
means that the outer for loop runs less iterations, which actually speeds up the
code.

Let's look at an example of how this algorithm works, for $n = 252$.

<center>

| $i$ | $n$   | $\texttt{ret}$              |
| --- | ----- | ---------------- |
| $2$ | $252$ | $\{\}$           |
| $2$ | $126$ | $\{2\}$          |
| $2$ | $63$  | $\{2, 2\}$       |
| $3$ | $21$  | $\{2, 2, 3\}$    |
| $3$ | $7$   | $\{2, 2, 3, 3\}$ |

</center>

At this point, the for loop terminates, because $i$ is already 3 which is
greater than $\lfloor \sqrt{7} \rfloor$. In the last step, we add $7$ to the
list of factors $v$, because it otherwise won't be added, for a final prime
factorization of $\{2, 2, 3, 3, 7\}$.

### Solution - Counting Divisors

The most straightforward solution is just to do what the problem asks us to do -
for each $x$, find the number of divisors of $x$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt x)$ time.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	for (int q = 0; q < n; q++) {
		int x;
		int div_num = 0;
		cin >> x;
		for (int i = 1; i * i <= x; i++) {
			if (x % i == 0) { div_num += i * i == x ? 1 : 2; }
		}
		cout << div_num << '\n';
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Divisors {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int queryNum = Integer.parseInt(read.readLine());
		StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
		for (int q = 0; q < queryNum; q++) {
			int x = Integer.parseInt(read.readLine());
			int divisors = 0;
			for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
				if (x % i == 0) { divisors += i * i == x ? 1 : 2; }
			}
			ans.append(divisors).append('\n');
		}
		System.out.print(ans);
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

<Warning>

Due to Python's big constant factor, the following code TLEs on quite a few test cases.

</Warning>

```py
ans = []
for _ in range(int(input())):
	div_num = 0
	x = int(input())
	i = 1
	while i * i <= x:
		if x % i == 0:
			div_num += 1 if i**2 == x else 2
		i += 1
	ans.append(div_num)

print("\n".join(str(i) for i in ans))
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

This solution runs in $\mathcal{O}(n \sqrt x)$ time, which is just fast enough
to get AC. However, we can actually speed this up to get an
$\mathcal{O}((x + n) \log x)$ solution!

First, let's discuss an important property of the prime factorization. Consider:

$$
x = {p_1}^{a_1} {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}
$$

Then the number of divisors of $x$ is simply
$(a_1 + 1) \cdot (a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1)$.

Why is this true? The exponent of $p_i$ in any divisor of $x$ must be in the
range $[0, a_i]$ and each different exponent results in a different set of
divisors, so each $p_i$ contributes $a_i + 1$ to the product.

$x$ can have $\mathcal{O}(\log x)$ distinct prime factors, so if we can find the
prime factorization of $x$ efficiently, we can use it with the above property to
answer queries in $\mathcal{O}(\log x)$ time instead of the previous
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt x)$ time.

Here's how we find the prime factorization of $x$ in $\mathcal{O}(\log x)$ time
with $\mathcal{O}(x \log x)$ preprocessing:

1. For each $k \leq 10^6$, find any prime number that divides $k$.
   To find this, we can use the
   [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
   which runs in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the larger numbers we consider.
   There's also a version of the sieve that runs in
   [linear time](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/54090), but we won't be needing it.
2. We can find the prime factorization of $x$ by repeatedly dividing
   it by the prime numbers we calculated earlier until $x = 1$.

Using this method gives us the following code:

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 1e6;
// max_div[i] contains the largest prime that goes into i
int max_div[MAX_N + 1];

int main() {
	for (int i = 2; i <= MAX_N; i++) {
		if (max_div[i] == 0) {
			for (int j = i; j <= MAX_N; j += i) { max_div[j] = i; }
		}
	}

	int n;
	cin >> n;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int x;
		cin >> x;
		int div_num = 1;
		while (x != 1) {
			/*
			 * get the largest prime that can divide x and see
			 * how many times it goes into x (stored in count)
			 */
			int prime = max_div[x];
			int count = 0;
			while (x % prime == 0) {
				count++;
				x /= prime;
			}
			div_num *= count + 1;
		}
		cout << div_num << '\n';
	}
}
```

		int[] maxDiv = new int[MAX_N + 1];

					count++;

			ans.append(factNum).append('\n');
		}
		System.out.print(ans);

## GCD & LCM

### GCD

The **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the largest
integer that is a factor of both $a$ and $b$. In order to find the GCD of two
_non-negative_ integers, we use the **Euclidean Algorithm**, which is as
follows:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = \begin{cases}
	 a & b = 0 \\
	 \gcd(b, a \bmod b) & b \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

This algorithm can be implemented with a recursive function as follows:

<LanguageSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
public int gcd(int a, int b) { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
```

</JavaSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
```

For C++14, you can use the built-in `__gcd(a,b)`.

In C++17, there exists [`std::gcd`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd)
and [`std::lcm`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/lcm) in the
[`<numeric>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/numeric) header, so there's no
need to code your own GCD and LCM if you're using that version.

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
	return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)
```

You won't have to actually implement this in-contest,
as the built-in `math` library has a `gcd` and `lcm` function.

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

This function runs in $\mathcal{O}(\log ab)$ time because
$a\le b \implies b\pmod a <\frac{b}{2}$.

The worst-case scenario for the Euclidean algorithm is when $a$ and $b$ are
consecutive Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ and $F_{n + 1}$. In
this case, the algorithm will calculate that
$\gcd(F_n, F_{n + 1}) = \gcd(F_{n - 1}, F_n) = \dots = \gcd(0, F_1)$.
This takes a total of $n+1$ calls, which is proportional
to $\log \left(F_n F_{n+1}\right)$.

<!-- (See [this Math Stack Exchange answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2477328) -->
<!-- ^ this doesn't seem very helpful -->
<!-- Since $F_n = O(\varphi^n)$, the worst-case complexity of this algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\log ab)$. -->

### LCM

The **least common multiple (LCM)** of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the smallest
integer divisible by both $a$ and $b$. The LCM can be calculated with the GCD
using this property:

$$
\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)}
$$

<Warning>

Coding $\text{lcm}$ as `a * b / gcd(a, b)` might cause integer overflow if the
value of `a * b` is greater than the max size of the data type of `a * b` (e.g.
the max size of `int` in C++ and Java is around 2 billion).
Dividng `a` by `gcd(a, b)` first, then multiplying it by `b` will prevent
integer overflow if the result fits in an `int`.

</Warning>

Also, these two functions are associative, meaning that
if we want to take the GCD or LCM of more than two elements, we can do so two at
a time, in any order. For example,

$$
\gcd(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = \gcd(a_1, \gcd(a_2, \gcd(a_3, a_4))).
$$

### Properties

Euler's totient function - written using phi $\phi(n)$ -  counts the number of positive integers in the interval $[1,n]$ which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers $a$ and $b$
are coprime if their greatest common divisor is equal to 1 i.e. $gcd(a,b)=1$.

Here are the values of $\phi(n)$ for the first 20 numbers:

<center>

| n         | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20  |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\phi(n)$ | 1   | 1   | 2   | 2   | 4   | 2   | 6   | 4   | 6   | 4   | 10  | 4   | 12  | 6   | 8   | 8   | 16  | 6   | 18  | 8   |

</center>

The totient function is **multiplicative** meaning that $\phi(nm)=\phi(n) \cdot \phi(m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are coprime - $gcd(n, m)=1$. For example $\phi(15)=\phi(3 \cdot 5)=\phi(3) \cdot \phi(5) = 2 \cdot 4 = 8$.

Let's take a look at some edge cases for $\phi(n)$:
- If n is a prime number then $\phi(n)=n-1$ because $gcd(n, x)=1$ for all $1 \leq x < n$
- If n is a power of a prime number, $n=p^q$ where p is a prime number and $1 \leq q$ then\
  there are exactly $p^{q-1}$ numbers divisible by $p$, so
  $\phi(p^q)=p^{q} - p^{q-1} = p^{q-1}(p - 1)$

Using the multiplicative property and the last edge case we can compute the value of $\phi(n)$ from the factorization of number $n$.
Let the factorization be $n=p_1^{q_1} \cdot p_2^{q_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{q_k}$ where $p_i$ is a prime factor of $n$, then:

$$
\phi(n)=\phi(p_1^{q_1}) \cdot \phi(p_2^{q_2}) \cdot \ldots \cdot \phi(p_k^{q_k}) = p_1^{q_1-1}(p_1 - 1) \cdot p_2^{q_2-1}(p_2 - 1) \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{q_k-1}(q_k - 1)
$$

Below is an implementation for factorization in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$. It can be a little bit tricky to understand why we subtract $ans/p$ from $ans$. For example
$ans=p^q \cdot x$ ,where $p$ is a prime factor and $x$ is the rest of the prime factorization. By subtracting $\frac{ans}{p}=p^{q-1} \cdot x$ we end up with:
$p^q \cdot x - p^{q-1} \cdot x = p^{q-1} \cdot x \cdot (p - 1)$ which is exactly the form of $\phi(n)$ described a few linew above.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
int phi(int n) {
	int ans = n;
	for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {
		if (n % p == 0) {
			while (n % p == 0) { n /= p; }
			ans -= ans / p;
		}
	}
	if (n > 1) { ans -= ans / n; }
	return ans;
}
```

</CPPSection>

public static int phi(int n) {
	int ans = n;
	for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {
		if (n % p == 0) {
			while (n % p == 0) { n /= p; }
			ans -= ans / p;
		}
	}

	if (n > 1) { ans -= ans / n; }
	return ans;
}
```

def phi(n: int) -> int:
	ans = n
	p = 2
	while p * p <= n:
		if n % p == 0:
			while n % p == 0:
				n //= p
			ans -= ans // p
		p += 1

	if n > 1:
		ans -= ans // n

	return ans
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

Usually in problems we need to precompute the totient of all numbers between $1$ and $n$, then factorizing is not efficient. The idea is the same as the
Sieve of Eratosthenes. Since it's almost the same with the Sieve of Eratosthenes the time complexity will be: $\mathcal{n\log{n}\log{n}}$.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
void precompute() {
	for (int i = 1; i < MAX_N; i++) { phi[i] = i; }
	for (int i = 2; i < MAX_N; i++) {
		// If i is prime
		if (phi[i] == i) {
			for (int j = i; j < MAX_N; j += i) { phi[j] -= phi[j] / i; }
		}
	}
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
public static void precompute() {
	for (int i = 1; i < MAX_N; i++) { phi[i] = i; }

	for (int i = 2; i < MAX_N; i++) {
		// If i is prime
		if (phi[i] == i) {
			for (int j = i; j < MAX_N; j += i) { phi[j] -= phi[j] / i; }
		}
	}
}
```

def precompute():
	for i in range(1, MAX_N):
		phi[i] = i

	for i in range(2, MAX_N):
		# If i is prime

			for j in range(i, MAX_N, i):
				phi[j] -= phi[j] // i
```

### Solution

The queries ask us for the sum of the greatest common divisor between all the numbers smaller than $n$.

Let's start by defining a function $f(n, d)$ as how many pairs of numbers less or equal than $n$ have the greatest common divisor equal to $d$. i.e. $gcd(a, b)=d$.

Defining the function this way gives us the following equation: $f(n,d)=f(\frac{n}{d}, 1)$.
The reasong why is simple: By choosing two coprime numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a,b \le \frac{n}{d}$,
we can make sure $a \cdot d, b \cdot d \le n$ and $gcd(a \cdot d, b \cdot d) = d$, thus contributing to the global answer.

Shifting away to our new function $f(\frac{n}{d}, 1)$ allows us to compute $f(n, d)$ more easily using a slightly modified phi function preprocessing.
To find the sum we multiply $f(n, d)$ with $d$.

This way the answer for a query is $\sum_{d=1}^{n}d \cdot f(n, d) = \sum_{d=1}^{n}d \cdot f(\frac{n}{d}, 1)$.

	for (int i = d; i >= 1; i--) { ans -= 1LL * (n / i - n / (i + 1)) * solve(i); }
	memo[n] = ans;

	return ans;
}

int main() {
	// Precompute the values of phi as previously shown

**Exercise:** What's wrong with the following code?

```cpp
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return a / gcd(a, b) * b; }
int main() { cout << lcm(1000000000, 999999999); }  // output: 1808348672
```

<Spoiler title="Solution">

The code outputs the correct result (`999999999000000000`) for C++14 and
earlier. However, C++17 has built in `gcd(a,b)` and `lcm(a,b)` ...
