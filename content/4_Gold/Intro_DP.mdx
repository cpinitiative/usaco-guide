**Dynamic Programming** (DP) is an important algorithmic technique in
Competitive Programming from the gold division to competitions like the
International Olympiad of Informatics. By breaking down the full task into
sub-problems, DP avoids the redundant computations of brute force solutions.

Although it is not too difficult to grasp the general ideas behind DP, the
technique can be used in a diverse range of problems and is a must-know idea for
competitors in the USACO Gold division.

<Info title="Pro Tip">

It's usually a good idea to write a slower solution first. For example, if the
complexity required for full points is $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and you come up with a
simple $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ solution, then you should definitely type that up
first and earn some partial credit. Afterwards, you can rewrite parts of your
slow solution until it is of the desired complexity. The slow solution might
also serve as something to [stress test](/general/basic-debugging#stress-testing)
against.

## Example - Frog 1

<FocusProblem problem='focus' />

The problem asks us to compute the minimum total cost it takes for a frog to
travel from stone $1$ to stone $N (N \le 10^5)$ given that the frog can only
jump a distance of one or two. The cost to travel between any two stones $i$ and
$j$ is given by $|h_i - h_j|$, where $h_i$ represents the height of stone $i$.

### Without Dynamic Programming

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(2^N)$

Since there are only two options, we can use recursion to compute what would
happen if we jumped either $1$ stone, or $2$ stones. There are two
possibilities, so recursively computing would require computing both a left and
right subtree. Therefore, for every additional jump, each branch splits into
two, which results in an exponential time complexity.

However, this can be sped up
with dynamic programming by keeping track of "optimal states" in order to avoid
calculating states multiple times. For example, recursively calculating jumps of length
$1,2,1$ and $2,1,2$ reuses the state of stone $3$. Dynamic programming provides
the mechanism to cache such states.

### With Dynamic Programming

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

There are two main DP approaches:
- **Push DP**, where we update future states based on the current state
- **Pull DP**, where we calculate the current state based on past states

We present both approaches below.

#### Push DP

There are only two options: jumping once, or jumping twice. Define
$\texttt{dp}[i]$ as the minimum cost to reach stone $i$. Then, our transitions are as follows:

- Jump one stone, incurring a cost of $|\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i+1}|$:

  $$
  \texttt{dp}[i + 1] = \min(\texttt{dp}[i + 1], \texttt{dp}[i] + |\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i + 1}|)
  $$

- Jump two stones, incurring a cost of
  $|\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i + 2}|$:
  $$
  \texttt{dp}[i + 2] = \min(\texttt{dp}[i + 2], \texttt{dp}[i] + |\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i + 2}|)
  $$

We can start with the base case that $\texttt{dp}[0] = 0$, since the frog is
already on that square, and proceed to calculate
$\texttt{dp}[1], \texttt{dp}[2], \ldots \texttt{dp}[N - 1]$.

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int N;
	cin >> N;
	vector<int> height(N);
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { cin >> height[i]; }

	// dp[N] is the minimum cost to get to the Nth stone
	vector<int> dp(N, INT_MAX);
	// dp[0] = 0 is our base case since we're already at the first stone
	dp[0] = 0;

	// for each state, calculate the states it leads to
	for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
		// jump one stone
		dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i + 1], dp[i] + abs(height[i] - height[i + 1]));
		// jump two stones
		if (i + 2 < N) {
			dp[i + 2] = min(dp[i + 2], dp[i] + abs(height[i] - height[i + 2]));
		}
	}

	cout << dp[N - 1] << endl;
}

		dp[i + 2] = min(dp[i + 2], dp[i] + abs(height[i] - height[i + 2]))

print(dp[stone_num])
```

</PySection>
</LanguageSection>

#### Pull DP

There are two ways to get to stone $i$: from stone $i - 1$ and stone $i - 2$.
- Jump from stone $i - 1$, incurring a cost of $|\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i-1}|$:

  $$
  \texttt{dp}[i] = \min(\texttt{dp}[i], \texttt{dp}[i - 1] + |\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i - 1}|)
  $$

- Jump from stone $i - 2$, incurring a cost of
  $|\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i - 2}|$:
  $$
  \texttt{dp}[i] = \min(\texttt{dp}[i], \texttt{dp}[i - 2] + |\text{height}_i - \text{height}_{i - 2}|)
  $$

	// for each state, process the states that lead to it

		// jump one stone

## Classical Problems

The next few modules provide examples of some classical problems: Dynamic
Programming problems which are well known. However, classical doesn't
necessarily mean common. Since so many competitors know about these problems,
problemsetters rarely set direct applications of them.

<!-- Solutions for most of these problems can be found in Chapter 7 of CPH.
 -->

## Introductory Problems

Easier problems that don't require many optimizations or complex states.

<Info title="Note - Ordering of DP Modules">

You are **not** expected to complete all of the problems below before starting
the other DP modules. In particular, we recommend that you begin with the "easy"
problems from the [knapsack](/gold/knapsack) module if this is your first
encounter with DP.
