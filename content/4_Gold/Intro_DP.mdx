**Dynamic Programming** (DP) is an important algorithmic technique in Competitive Programming from the gold division to competitions like the International Olympiad of Informatics. By breaking down the full task into sub-problems, DP avoids the redundant computations of brute force solutions.

Although it is not too difficult to grasp the general ideas behind DP, the technique can be used in a diverse range of problems and is a must-know idea for competitors in the USACO Gold division.

<Info title="Pro Tip">

It's usually a good idea to write a slower solution first. For example, if the complexity required for full points is $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and you come up with a simple $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ solution, then you should definitely type that up first and earn some partial credit. Afterwards, you can rewrite parts of your slow solution until it is of the desired complexity. The slow solution might also serve as something to [stress test](/general/debugging-lang#stress-testing) against.

## Classical Problems

The next few modules provide examples of some classical problems, or Dynamic Programming problems which are well known. However, classical doesn't necessarily mean common. Since so many competitors know about these problems, problemsetters rarely set direct applications of them. <!-- Solutions for most of these problems can be found in Chapter 7 of CPH.
 -->

### Problemsets

<!-- Dynamic Programming is a huge topic, so if you want more practice,  -->

<!-- Here are some other classical problemsets that we found interesting. -->

Some of these problems will be mentioned in the next few modules.

## Introductory USACO

Easier USACO problems that don't require many optimizations or complex states.

<Info title="Note - Ordering of DP Modules">

You are **not** expected to complete all of the problems below before starting the other DP modules. In particular, we recommend that you begin with the "easy" problems from the [knapsack](/gold/knapsack) module if this is your first encounter with DP.

## Harder USACO

<!-- Finish with some more challenging Dynamic Programming problems!  -->

<!-- Can be very difficult.  -->

<!-- You might want to try easier tasks in the next few modules first. -->

<!-- so skip around if you want. -->
