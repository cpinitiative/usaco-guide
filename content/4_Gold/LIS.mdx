## Tutorial

In this tutorial, let $A$ be the array we want to find the LIS for.

### Slow Solution

**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal O(N^2)$

Let $dp[i]$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends on
$A[i]$. We can then naively compute $dp$ (and thus the LIS) in
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time:

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int find_lis(vector<int> a) {
	int lis = 0;
	vector<int> dp(a.size(), 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
			if (a[j] < a[i]) {
				dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
			}
		}
		lis = max(lis, dp[i]);
	}
	return lis;
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
public static int findLis(int[] a) {
	int lis = 0;
	int[] dp = new int[a.length];
	Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
			if (a[j] < a[i]) {
				dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
			}
		}
		lis = Math.max(lis, dp[i]);
	}
	return lis;
}
```

</JavaSection>
<PySection>

```py
from typing import List


def find_lis(a: List[int]) -> int:
	lis = 0
	dp = [1] * len(a)
	for i in range(len(a)):
		for j in range(i):
			if a[j] < a[i]:
				dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
		lis = max(lis, dp[i])
	return lis
```

</PySection>

We can do much better than this though!

### Fast Solution

**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal O(N \log N)$

Let $L_i$ be an array (0-indexed) where $L_i[j]$ is the smallest element from
the first $i$ elements of $A$ with an increasing sequence of length $j + 1$
ending on it (or $\infty$ if there is no such element).

For example, let our array be $[2, 18, 7, 20, 18, 5, 18, 15, 13, 19, 9]$.

In this case, $L_8$ would be $[2, 5, 15]$. Some example sequences satisfying
these are $[2]$, $[2, 5]$, and $[2, 5, 15]$.

**Lemma 1:** $L_i$ forms a strictly increasing sequence.

**Proof:** Assume for a contradiction that for some $j$, we have
$L_i[j - 1] \geq L_i[j]$. Let $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{j}$ be any increasing
subsequence of length $j + 1$ ending on $L_i[j]$ (so $a_j = L_i[j]$). Notice
that $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{j - 1}$ is an increasing subsequence of length $j$.
Thus, $L_i[j]$ has to be greater than $L_i[j - 1]$. From that, we can write this
equation: $L_i[j - 1] \leq a_{j-1} < a_j = L_i[j]$, which is exactly what we
wanted.

**Lemma 2:** The length of the LIS ending on $A[i + 1]$ is equal to the least
index $j$ (with 0-indexing) such that $L_i[j] \geq A[i + 1]$.

**Proof:** Let $j$ be defined as it is in the statement. First of all, since
$A[i + 1] > L_i[j - 1]$, there is an increasing sequence of length $j$ ending on
$A[i + 1]$, as we can append $A[i + 1]$ to the end of the sequence of length
$j$. By Lemma 1, $L_i$ is strictly increasing, so $L_i[k] \geq A[i + 1]$ for all
$k \geq j$. This means that there cannot be a LIS ending at $A[i + 1]$ longer
than $j + 1$.

**Lemma 3:** At most 1 element differs between $L_i$ and $L_{i + 1}$.

**Proof:** Let $j$ be defined as it was in Lemma 2. We need to set
$L_{i + 1}[j]$ to be $A[i + 1]$ since $A[i + 1] \leq L_i[j]$.
$L_{i + 1}[k] = L_i[k]$ for all $k \neq j$, though, since $A[i + 1] > L_i[k]$
for all $k < j$ and there are no increasing sequences ending on $A[i + 1]$ for
$k > j$.

To find and update the described $j$ in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time, we can use a
list with binary search, or we can use a sorted set (as demonstrated in the
solution for PCB).

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int find_lis(vector<int> a) {
	vector<int> dp;
	for (int i : a) {
		int pos = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), i) - dp.begin();
		if (pos == dp.size()) {
			// we can have a new, longer increasing subsequence!
			dp.push_back(i);
		} else {
			// oh ok, at least we can make the ending element smaller
			dp[pos] = i;
		}
	}
	return dp.size();
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
public static int findLis(int[] a) {
	ArrayList<Integer> dp = new ArrayList<Integer>();
	for (int i : a) {
		int pos = Collections.binarySearch(dp, i);
		pos = pos < 0 ? Math.abs(pos + 1) : pos;
		if (pos == dp.size()) {
			// we can have a new, longer increasing subsequence!
			dp.add(i);
		} else {
			// oh ok, at least we can make the ending element smaller
			dp.set(pos, i);
		}
	}
	return dp.size();
}
```

</JavaSection>

```py
from typing import List
from bisect import bisect_left


def find_lis(arr: List[int]) -> int:
	min_endings = []
	for i in arr:
		pos = bisect_left(min_endings, i)
		if pos == len(min_endings):  # we can have a new, longer increasing subsequence!
			min_endings.append(i)
		else:  # oh ok, at least we can make the ending element smaller
			min_endings[pos] = i
	return len(min_endings)
```

### Fast Solution (RMQ Data Structures)

**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal O(N \log N)$, but perhaps a constant factor
slower than the previous solution.

Note that the following solution assumes knowledge of a basic PURQ data
structure for RMQ (range max query). Suitable implementations include a segment
tree or a modified Fenwick tree, but both of these are generally considered
Platinum level topics. However, this solution has the advantage of being more
intuitive if you're deriving LIS on the spot.

Let $\texttt{dp}[k]$ be the length of the LIS of $a$ that ends with the element
$k \in a$. Our base case is obviously $\texttt{dp}[a[0]] = 1$ (we have an LIS
containing only $a[0]$, which has length $1$). Since LIS exhibits optimal
substructure, we transition as follows, processing
$\forall t \in a[1 \dots n-1]$ from left to right (which we must do in order to
maintain the property that our subsequence strictly increases in this
direction):

$$
\texttt{dp}[t] = \max_{0 \leq k < t} \texttt{dp}[k] + 1.
$$

If $\texttt{dp}$ is now a RMQ data structure, the change in $\texttt{dp}[t]$ is
merely a point update, while the calculation of
$\max\limits_{0 \leq k < t} \texttt{dp}[k]$ is a range query.

Our final answer is just an RMQ from end to end (or, alternatively, you could
keep a running max of the answer in another variable and change it with each
update). This method actually gives us the leisure to process online as long as
our elements are small enough to be used as indices, or if we use a more
advanced data structure such as a sparse segment tree. If we are willing to
process offline as we often can, however, we can avoid using a more advanced
technique: it suffices to collect the array elements and sort them to coordinate
compress, creating $\texttt{dp}$ with those compressed IDs instead.

The implementation follows:

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

//BeginCodeSnip{Range Maximum Segment Tree}
class MaxSegTree {
	private:
		int len;
		vector<int> segtree;
	public:
		MaxSegTree(int len) : len(len), segtree(2 * len) { }

		void set(int ind, int val) {
			for (segtree[ind += len] = val; ind > 1; ind >>= 1) {
				segtree[ind >> 1] = max(segtree[ind], segtree[ind ^ 1]);
			}
		}

		// maximum of the range [from, to)
		int range_max(int from, int to) {
			int max_ = INT32_MIN;
			for (from += len, to += len; from < to; from >>= 1, to >>= 1) {
				if ((from & 1) != 0) {
					max_ = max(max_, segtree[from++]);
				}
				if ((to & 1) != 0) {
					max_ = max(max_, segtree[--to]);
				}
			}
			return max_;
		}
};
//EndCodeSnip

int find_lis(vector<int> a) {
	// apply coordinate compression to all elements of the array
	vector<int> sorted(a);
	sort(sorted.begin(), sorted.end());
	int at = 0;
	map<int, int> coord_comp;
	for (int i : sorted) {
		if (!coord_comp.count(i)) {
			coord_comp[i] = at++;
		}
	}
	// cmp(i) gives the compressed version of index i
	auto cmp = [&] (int i) -> int { return coord_comp[a[i]]; };

	MaxSegTree dp(coord_comp.size());
	dp.set(cmp(0), 1);
	for (int i = 1; i < a.size(); i++) {
		dp.set(cmp(i), dp.range_max(0, cmp(i)) + 1);
	}
	return dp.range_max(0, coord_comp.size());

## Example - PCB

<FocusProblem problem="nonIntersect" />

This problem asks us to find the minimum number of disjoint sets of
non-intersecting segments. This seems quite intimidating, so let's break it up
into two parts:

- Finding a set of non-intersecting segments
- Minimizing the number of these sets

### Application 1 - Non-intersecting Segments

First, what can we say about two segments $(l_1, r_1)$ and $(l_2, r_2)$ if they
intersect (assuming $l_1 < l_2$)?

Since these segments are straight, notice how $l_1 < l_2 \implies r_1 > r_2$.

This means that a set of non-intersecting segments satisfies
$l_i < l_j \implies r_i < r_j$ for all pairs $(i, j)$!

Let $A$ be an array where $A[i] = x$ means that the segment with its right
endpoint at position $i$ has its left endpoint at position $x$.

If we were asked to find the maximum size of a set of non-intersecting segments,
the answer would be the LIS of $A$!

### Application 2 - Minimum Number of Increasing Sequences

Continuing from application 1, we now want to find the minimum number of
increasing subsequences required to cover $A$.

Luckily for us, there's a simple (though not so obvious) solution to this.

**Lemma (Easy):** The minimum number of increasing subsequences required to
cover $A$ is at least the size of longest non-increasing subsequence of $A$.

_Proof:_ No two elements of any non-increasing subsequence can be part of the
same increasing subsequence.

**Claim:** The minimum number of increasing subsequences required to cover $A$
is equal to the size of longest non-increasing subsequence of $A$!

**Wrong Proof 1:** See
[cp-algo](https://cp-algorithms.com/sequences/longest_increasing_subsequence.html#toc-tgt-13)
(note that this link describes partitioning $A$ into non-increasing subsequences
rather than increasing subsequences). However, it's not correct because the
process of unhooking and reattaching might never terminate. For example,
consider partitioning $A=(3,1,2)$ into the non-increasing subsequences
$s_1=(3,1)$ and $s_2=(2)$. Then $3$ will be moved from the front of $s_1$ to the
front of $s_2$ on the first step, back to $s_1$ on the second step, and so on.

**Wrong Proof 2:**
[This](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3739994/find-minimum-number-of-increasing-subsequences)
is essentially the same as the above.

**Motivation:** Consider the obvious greedy strategy to construct the collection
of increasing subsequences (essentially
[patience sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_sorting)). For each
element $x$ of $A$ from left to right, add it to the increasing subsequence with
last element less than $x$ such that the value of this last element is
maximized. If no such increasing subsequence currently exists, then start a new
increasing subsequence with $x$.

This algorithm performs exactly the same steps as the algorithm to compute the
length of the longest non-increasing subsequence, so it follows that they return
the same result.

**Proof:** Let $f_i$ denote the length of longest non-increasing subsequence
ending at $A_i$. Then the $A_i$'s satisfying $f_i=t$ for a fixed $t$ are an
increasing subsequence for each $t$. So we have covered $A$ with (size of
longest non-increasing subsequence) increasing subsequences, done.

Do you see why this is equivalent to the sketch?

**Alternative Proof:** This is just a special case of
[Dilworth's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilworth%27s_theorem). See
the inductive proof.
