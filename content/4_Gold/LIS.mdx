## Tutorial

In this tutorial, let $A$ be the array we want to find the LIS for.

### $O(N^2)$

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="7.2 - LIS">slow solution</Resource>
</Resources>

Let $dp[i]$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends on $A[i]$. We can then naively compute $dp$ (and thus the LIS) in $O(N^2)$ time:

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int find_lis(vector<int> a) {
	int n = a.size(), lis = 0;
	vector<int> dp(n, 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) 
			if (a[j] < a[i]) 
				dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
		lis = max(lis, dp[i]);
	}
	return lis;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java

public static int find_lis(int[] a) {
   int n = a.length, lis = 0;
   int[] dp = new int[n]; Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) 
         if (a[j] < a[i]) 
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      lis = Math.max(lis, dp[i]);
   }
   return lis;
}

```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>

We can do much better than this though!

### $O(N \log N)$

Let $L_i$ be an array where $L_i[j]$ is the smallest element from the first $i$ elements of $A$ with an increasing sequence of length $j$ ending on it (or $\infty$ if there is no such element).

**Lemma 1:** $L_i$ forms a non-decreasing sequence.

**Proof:** Assume for a contradiction that for some $j$, we have $L_i[j] > L_i[j + 1]$. However, this is impossible because an increasing sequence of length $j + 1$ ending on some element implies that there is also an increasing sequence of length $j$ ending on that same sequence.

**Lemma 2:** The length of the LIS ending on $A[i + 1]$ is equal to the least index $j$ such that $L_i[j] \geq A[i + 1]$.

**Proof:** Firstly, since $A[i + 1] > L_i[j - 1]$, there is an increasing sequence of length $j$ ending on $A[i + 1]$. By Lemma 1, $L_i$ is non-decreasing, so $L_i[k] \geq A[i + 1]$ for all $k \geq j$. This means that the length of the LIS is $j$.

**Lemma 3:** Exactly 1 element differs between $L_i$ and $L_{i + 1}$.

**Proof:** Obviously, we need to set $L_{i + 1}[j]$ to be $A[i + 1]$ since $L_i[j] \geq A[i + 1]$. We don't update anything else though, since $A[i + 1] > L_i[k]$ for all $k < j$ and there are no increasing sequences ending on $A[i + 1]$ of length greater than $j$.

To find and update the described $j$ in $O(\log N)$ time, we can use a `std::vector` and `std::lower_bound`. Alternatively, we can use a `std::set` (demonstrated in the solution for PCB).

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int find_lis(vector<int> a) {
	vector<int> dp;
	for (int i : a) {
		int pos = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), i) - dp.begin();
		if (pos == dp.size()) dp.push_back(i);
		else dp[pos] = i;
	}
	return dp.size();
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
public static int find_lis(int[] a) {
   ArrayList<Integer> dp = new ArrayList<Integer>();
   for (int i : a) {
      int pos = Collections.binarySearch(dp, i);
      if(pos < 0) pos = Math.abs(pos + 1);
      if (pos == dp.size()) dp.add(i);
      else dp.set(pos, i);
   }
   return dp.size();
}
```

## Example - PCB

<FocusProblem problem={problems.nonIntersect} />

This problem asks us to find the minimum number of disjoint sets of non-intersecting segments. This seems quite intimidating, so let's break it up into two parts:

- Finding a set of non-intersecting segments
- Minimizing the number of these sets

### Application 1 - Non-intersecting Segments

First, what can we say about two segments $(l_1, r_1)$ and $(l_2, r_2)$ if they intersect (assuming $l_1 < l_2$)?

Since these segments are straight, notice how $l_1 < l_2 \implies r_1 > r_2$.

This means that a set of non-intersecting segments satisfies $l_i < l_j \implies r_i < r_j$ for all pairs $(i, j)$!

Let $A$ be an array where $A[i] = x$ means that the segment with its right endpoint at position $i$ has its left endpoint at position $x$.

If we were asked to find the maximum size of a set of non-intersecting segments, the answer would be the LIS of $A$!

### Application 2 - Minimum Number of Increasing Sequences

Continuing from application 1, we now want to find the minimum number of increasing subsequences required to cover $A$.

Luckily for us, there's a simple (though not so obvious) solution to this.

**Lemma (Easy):** The minimum number of increasing subsequences required to cover $A$ is at least the size of longest non-increasing subsequence of $A$.

*Proof:* No two elements of any non-increasing subsequence can be part of the same increasing subsequence.

**Claim:** The minimum number of increasing subsequences required to cover $A$ is equal to the size of longest non-increasing subsequence of $A$!

**Wrong Proof 1:** See [cp-algo](https://cp-algorithms.com/sequences/longest_increasing_subsequence.html#toc-tgt-13) (note that this link describes partitioning $A$ into non-increasing subsequences rather than increasing subsequences). However, it's not correct because the process of unhooking and reattaching might never terminate. For example, consider partitioning $A=(3,1,2)$ into the non-increasing subsequences $s_1=(3,1)$ and $s_2=(2)$. Then $3$ will be moved from the front of $s_1$ to the front of $s_2$ on the first step, back to $s_1$ on the second step, and so on. 

**Wrong Proof 2:** [This](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3739994/find-minimum-number-of-increasing-subsequences) is essentially the same as the above.

**Motivation:** Consider the obvious greedy strategy to construct the collection of increasing subsequences (essentially [patience sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_sorting)). For each element $x$ of $A$ from left to right, add it to the increasing subsequence with last element less than $x$ such that the value of this last element is maximized. If no such increasing subsequence currently exists, then start a new increasing subsequence with $x$.

This algorithm performs exactly the same steps as the algorithm to compute the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence, so it follows that they return the same result.

**Proof:** Let $f_i$ denote the length of longest non-increasing subsequence ending at $A_i$. Then the $A_i$'s satisfying $f_i=t$ for a fixed $t$ are an increasing subsequence for each $t$. So we have covered $A$ with (size of longest non-increasing subsequence) increasing subsequences, done. 

Do you see why this is equivalent to the sketch?

**Alternative Proof:** This is just a special case of [Dilworth's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilworth%27s_theorem). See the inductive proof.
