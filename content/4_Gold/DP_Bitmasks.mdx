## Solution

<Spoiler title = "Solution">

Let $dp[S][i]$ be the number of routes that visit all the cities in the subset
$S$ and end at city $i$. The transitions will then be:

$$
dp[S][i] = \sum_{x \in adj[i]} dp[S  \setminus \{i\}][x] \text{ if $x \in S$}
$$

where $S  \setminus \{i\}$ is the subset $S$ without city $i$.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long

const int MX = (1 << 20);
ll dp[MX][21];
vector<int> adj[21];
const ll MOD = (ll)1e9+7;

int main() {
	int N, M; cin >> N >> M;
	for(int i = 0; i < M; i++){
		int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
		adj[b].push_back(a);
	}
	dp[1][1] = 1;
	for(int s = 2; s < 1 << N; s++){
		if((s & (1 << (N-1))) && s != ((1 << N) - 1)) continue;
		for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
			if((s & (1 << (i-1))) == 0) continue;
			for(int j : adj[i]){
				if((s & (1 << (j-1)))){
					dp[s][i] += dp[s - (1 << (i-1))][j]; dp[s][i] %= MOD;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	cout << dp[(1 << N) - 1][N] % MOD << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```

## Bitmask over Primes

### Rough Idea

In some number theory problems, it helps to represent each number were
represented by a bitmask of its prime divisors. For example, the set
$\{6, 10, 15 \}$ can be represented by $\{0b011, 0b101, 0b110 \}$ (in binary),
where the bits correspond to divisibility by $[2, 3, 5]$.

Then, here are some equivalent operations between masks and these integers:

- Bitwise AND is GCD
- Bitwise OR is LCM
- Iterating over bits is iterating over prime divisors
- Iterating over submasks is iterating over divisors

<!--
In particular those that involve making GCD equal to $1$, may be optimized using a sort of bitmask over primes.
 -->

Choosing a set with GCD $1$ is equivalent to choosing a set of bitmasks that AND
to $0$. For example, we can see that $\{6, 10 \}$ doesn't have GCD $1$ because
$0b011 \& 0b101 = 0b001 \neq 0$. On the other hand, $\{6, 10, 15 \}$ has GCD $1$
because $0b011 \& 0b101 \& 0b110 = 0b000 = 0$.

<!-- 
Therefore, if we have a reasonably short list of primes (perhaps $\leq 20$), then we can simply represent numbers with their prime divisors bitmask and change the NT problem to a bitmask problem.
(Similar ideas can be used to tackle Professional Layer/Nora's Toy Boxes)

However, in less restricted cases, there are usually much more than just 20 bits.
Suppose the upper limit on input integers is $100000$.
There are $9592$ primes that are less than $100000$, and if each of those primes represents a bit, then we would have way too many possible bitmasks.
However, with only $100000$ distinct integers, clearly we do not need to consider all $2^{9592}$ bitmasks.

Notice how masks like $0b1100 \dots 000$ (which corresponds to $99991 \times 99989 = 9998000099$) exceed the maximum limit on the input.
Thus, they would never actually be used. 
In fact, the vast majority of the $2^{9592}$ masks are unusable in the same way;
we only care about the masks which correspond to integers less than the upper limit, which in this case is $100000$.

Additionally, bitmasks of length $9592$ are extraordinarily long.
Since we know a conservative bound of $100000$ different bitmasks anyways, one may consider trying to assign each bitmask to an integer between $1$ and $100000$.
In fact, the simplest way to do this is just to assign each bitmask to the integer it corresponds to -- ignoring the mask altogether!
(Notice how not all integers actually correspond to a bitmask. The bitmask corresponding to $4$, for example, would be represented by the integer $2$)

<!-- Operating like this makes it easier to think about and apply PIE or SOS wrt numbers and GCDs. -->

<!-- (Similar ideas can be used to tackle Gold Experience) -->

Maybe this is just standard NT, but I've always thought about it as a bitmask.
Also, any tutorials or more problems of this type?
