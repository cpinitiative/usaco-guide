Let's take a look at some examples to better understand bitwise operators. Note
that you typically won't be asked to use bitwise operators to implement
addition/multiplication.

## Example - Addition

Try implementing addition using bitwise operators!
You can test your implementation [here](http://poj.org/problem?id=1000).

<Spoiler title="Solution">

If we perform addition without carrying, then we are simply performing the XOR
(`^`) operator. Then, the bits that we carry over are those equivalent to $1$ in
both numbers: $a\&b$.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
	while (b > 0) {
		int carry = a & b;
		a ^= b;
		b = carry << 1;
	}
	return a;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
	while (b > 0) {
		int carry = a & b;
		a ^= b;
		b = carry << 1;
	}
	return a;
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
	while b > 0:
		carry = a & b
		a ^= b
		b = carry << 1
	return a
```

## Example - Multiplication

Now try implementing multiplication using bitwise operators!
If you want to test your implementation of multiplication,
you can do so [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/handshake/problem).

<Spoiler title="Solution">

For simplicity, we will use the `sum` functions defined above. If we divide up
$b$ into $2^{b_1}+2^{b_2}+\dots+2^{b_n}$, we get the following:

$$
a \times b \\
= a \times (2^{b_1}+2^{b_2}+\dots+2^{b_n}) \\
= a2^{b_1}+a2^{b_2}+\dots+a2^{b_n} \\
= \sum_{\text{bits in b}} {a\texttt{<<}b_i}
$$

(This same idea is used in binary exponentiation!)

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int prod(int a, int b) {
	int c = 0;
	while (b > 0) {
		if ((b & 1) == 1) {
			c = add(c, a);  // Use the addition function we coded previously
		}
		a <<= 1;
		b >>= 1;
	}
	return c;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
public static int prod(int a, int b) {
	int c = 0;
	while(b > 0) {
		if ((b & 1) == 1) {
			c = add(c, a);  // Use the addition function we coded previously
		}
		a <<= 1;
		b >>= 1;
	}
	return c;
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
def prod(a: int, b: int) -> int:
	c = 0
	while b > 0:
		if b & 1:
			c = add(c, a)  # Use the addition function we coded previously
		a <<= 1
		b >>= 1
	return c
```
