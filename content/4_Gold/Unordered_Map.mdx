<Warning>

You can (almost always) use the sets introduced in the prerequisite module
instead, but it's good to know that these exist.

## Hashing

**Hashing** refers to assigning a unique code to every variable/object which
allows insertions, deletions, and searches in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, albeit with
a high constant factor, as hashing requires a large constant number of
operations. However, as the name implies, elements are not ordered in any
meaningful way, so traversals of an unordered set will return elements in some
arbitrary order.

Oftentimes, `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` can be used as a drop-in
replacement for their `map` and `set` counterparts, as long as the key does not require custom hashing.

The operations for `unordered_map` include:

- `insert`, `erase`, `count`, which all function the same as
  [sorted sets](/bronze/intro-sets)
- `find`, which returns the iterator to an element

All of these operations are $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but again, due to the hashing,
this has a high constant factor.

## Custom Hashing

There is no built in method for hashing pairs or vectors. Namely,
`unordered_set<vector<int>>` does not work. In this case, we can use an
[sorted map](/silver/intro-sorted-sets) (which supports all of the functions used
in the code above) or declare our own hash function.

The link provides an example of hashing pairs of strings, as well as other data
structures like pairs.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int,int> pi;
#define f first
#define s second

struct hashPi {
	size_t operator()(const pi& p) const { return p.f^p.s; }
};

int main() {
	unordered_map<pi,int,hashPi> um;
}
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int,int> pi;
#define f first
#define s second

namespace std {
	template<> struct hash<pi> {
		size_t operator()(const pi& p) const { return p.f^p.s; }
	};
}

int main() {
	unordered_map<pi,int> um;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Java has its own hash functions for objects. If we wanted to override it, we can
define the function `hashCode()` and set our own custom hash function that will
be used in `HashMaps`.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class HashTest{
	public static HashMap<Pair, Integer> map;
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		map = new HashMap<Pair, Integer>(); //uses custom hash function in class Pair
	}
	static class Pair {
		public int f, s;
		public Pair(int f, int s) {
			this.f = f;
			this.s = s;
		}
		public int hashCode(){
			return f^s;
		}
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>

However, this hash function is quite bad; if we insert
$(0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \ldots$ then they will all be mapped to the same bucket (so
it would easily be **hacked**).

## Hacking

<Warning>

You don't need to know this for USACO, but you will need this to pass some of
the problems in this module.

</Warning>

In USACO contests, unordered sets and maps generally fine, but the built-in
hashing algorithm for C++ is vulnerable to pathological data sets causing
abnormally slow runtimes. Apparently
[Java](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62393?#comment-464875) is not
vulnerable to this, however.

Essentially, use `unordered_map<int, int, custom_hash>` defined in the blog above
in place of `unordered_map<int, int>`.

	}
};
template<class K,class V> using um = unordered_map<K,V,chash>;
```
