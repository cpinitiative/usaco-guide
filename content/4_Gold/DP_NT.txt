## Permutations

<!-- Define the order of permutation $p$ as the number of times you need to apply $p$ to itself to get the identity permutation, or the permutation consisting of integers $1 \cdots N$ where $N$ is the length of permutation $p$.
 -->

<!-- We'll decompose the permutations into disjoint cycles. Then, observe that a cycle of length $l$ takes $l$ operations to match the identity permutation. That means that for $M$ cycles, the permutation requires $LCM(l_1, l_2, \cdots, l_M)$ operations for all the cycles to match the identity permutation.

For a more formal proof, see [this article](http://mathonline.wikidot.com/the-order-of-a-permutation).

#### Example - Exercise

<FocusProblem problem="permutations" />

Using the fact above, we can rephrase the problem as follows: find the sum of integers $K$ such that there exists an array of lengths $l$ such that

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{sz(l)} l_i = N
$$

and

$$
LCM(l_1, l_2, \cdots l_{sz(l)}) = K
$$
