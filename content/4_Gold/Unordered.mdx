<Warning>

You can (almost always) use the sets introduced in the prerequisite module instead, but it's good to know that these exist.

## Hashing

**Hashing** refers to assigning a unique code to every variable/object which allows insertions, deletions, and searches in $O(1)$ time, albeit with a high constant factor, as hashing requires a large constant number of operations. However, as the name implies, elements are not ordered in any meaningful way, so traversals of an unordered set will return elements in some arbitrary order.

(more in-depth explanation?)

<IncompleteSection>

Introduce `unordered_set`, `unordered_map`, but no need to repeat code from previous module.

</IncompleteSection>

All of these operations are $O(1)$, but again, due to the hashing, this has a high constant factor.

## Custom Hashing

There is no built in method for hashing pairs or vectors. Namely, `unordered_set<vector<int>>` does not work. In this case, we can use an [ordered map](/silver/intro-ordered) (which supports all of the functions used in the code above) or declare our own hash function.

The link provides an example of hashing pairs of strings. More examples (for pairs of ints)


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int,int> pi;
#define f first
#define s second

struct hashPi {
	size_t operator()(const pi& p) const { return p.f^p.s; }
};

int main() {
	unordered_map<pi,int,hashPi> um;

}
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef pair<int,int> pi;
#define f first
#define s second

namespace std {
	template<> struct hash<pi> {
		size_t operator()(const pi& p) const { return p.f^p.s; }
	};
}

int main() {
	unordered_map<pi,int> um;

}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Java has its own hash functions for objects. If we wanted to override it, we can define the function `hashCode()` and set our own custom hash function that will be used in `HashMaps`.

```java
import java.io.*; 
import java.util.*; 

public class HashTest{
	public static HashMap<Pair, Integer> map;
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		map = new HashMap<Pair, Integer>(); //uses custom hash function in class Pair
	}
	static class Pair {
		public int f, s;
		public Pair(int f, int s) {
			this.f = f;
			this.s = s;
		}
		public int hashCode(){
			return f^s;
		}
	}
}
```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>


However, this hash function is quite bad; if we insert $(0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \ldots$ then they will all be mapped to the same bucket (so it would easily be **hacked**).

## Hacking

<Warning>

You don't need to know this for USACO, but you will need this to pass some of the problems in this module.

</Warning>

In USACO contests, unordered sets and maps generally fine, but the built-in hashing algorithm for C++ is vulnerable to pathological data sets causing abnormally slow runtimes. Apparently [Java](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62393?#comment-464875) is not vulnerable to this, however.

Essentially use `unordered_map<int, int, custom_hash>` defined in the blog above in place of `unordered_map<int, int>`.
