# Angry Cows (Gold Level)

## **Problem Overview**
A set of **hay bales** is placed on a number line. A cow can **start an explosion** at any hay bale, which then spreads **outward** at an increasing rate:
- At **t = 1**, the explosion spreads **1 unit** in both directions.
- At **t = 2**, it spreads **2 units** further.
- At **t = k**, it spreads **k units** further.

Find the **minimum explosion radius \( R \)** required to destroy all hay bales if the explosion starts at an optimal position.

---

## **Approach**
- We use **binary search** to find the smallest possible \( R \).
- For each \( R \), we **simulate** an explosion from each hay bale and check if it destroys all bales.
- The explosion **expands at an increasing rate** (1, 2, 3, â€¦).
- The **greedy approach** ensures we use the optimal starting bale.
