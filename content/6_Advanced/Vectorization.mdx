[Pragmas](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Pragmas.html) provide additional
information to the compiler. Sometimes you'll see the following lines at the
beginning of a program.

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize ("Ofast")
#pragma GCC target ("avx2")
```

According to KACTL:

- `#pragma GCC optimize ("Ofast")` will make GCC auto-vectorize for loops and
  optimizes floating points better (assumes associativity and turns off
  [denormals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number)).
- `#pragma GCC target ("avx,avx2")` can double performance of vectorized code,
  but causes crashes on old machines.

 <!-- - Also consider the older `#pragma GCC target ("sse4")`. -->

According to CodinGame,

> Modern CPUs can execute up to four instructions at the same time if they are
> independent.

Can also check Wikipedia articles about
[SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) and
[AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) (AVX is the more
advanced version).

### Where Can I Use These?

Whether these pragmas are supported depends on the computer architecture (see
[here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html#x86-Options)).

- `Ofast` with `avx2` works on CF and DMOJ.
- `sse4` and `avx` cause runtime errors on InfoArena and
  [Szkopuł](https://szkopul.edu.pl/). However,
  `#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")` seems to work on InfoArena (compare
  [TLE](https://www.infoarena.ro/job_detail/2641920) and
  [AC](https://www.infoarena.ro/job_detail/2641921)).
- I don't have reason to believe that these work for USACO.

### Why Should I _Not_ Use These?

From [this comment](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66279?#comment-502965):

It's **not** a good idea to include these pragmas at the start of every program.
As mentioned above, these pragmas cause RE on some sites. Other times, they are
just ignored by the compiler, or even worse, they might make your code slower
instead of faster (ex. see
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28875325/gcc-optimization-flag-o3-makes-code-slower-than-o2)).

<!-- Anyways, keep in mind that these rarely make a difference in competitive programming. -->
