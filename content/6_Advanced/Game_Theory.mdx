## Nim

<FocusProblem problem="nim" />

### Rules

Nim might be one of the most well-known examples in game theory. In this game
there are considered $n$ piles of some item. The problem uses sticks, while some
others use stones; we'll be using sticks to stay consistent with the CSES
problem. Regardless, players take turns removing a nonzero number of sticks from
a certain pile, and the player who takes the last stick wins.

Let's represent the current state of the piles with
$[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n]$, where $x_i$ is the number of sticks in pile $i$.
You'll soon see that it doesn't matter whether we include empty piles in our
array.

We now propose something that may seem unintuitive at first:

> The player who moves first can always win if the xor-sum of the sizes of the
> piles is nonzero.

### Proof

For our own sanity, we'll refer to a state with a xor-sum of 0 as a "losing
state" and a state with a nonzero xor-sum as a "winning state."

To prove this, we have to show that from a losing state, any move we make will
result in a winning state and vice versa. Notice that when we make our move, the
game switches to a "sub-game" of sorts where the second player becomes the first
player. Thus, moving to a winning state for the next turn means that they win
and we lose.

However, it's probably good to prove our base cases first. $[0]$ is a losing
state, since the first player can't make any moves and thus loses. On the other
hand, $[x]$ where $x$ is any positive integer is a winning state since we can
take $x$ sticks from the only pile. As we can see, the first state has a xor-sum
of $0$ while the second has a xor-sum of $x$ which is nonzero.

#### Losing $\rightarrow$ Winning

Let's first prove that any losing state will move to a winning state for the
other player.

Since XOR is a commutative and associative operation, we can assume WLOG that
the move we make is on pile $1$.

The current xor-sum of the state is $x_1 \oplus x_2 \oplus \cdots x_n=0$. Notice
that this can be thought of $x_1$ XOR the xor-sum of the rest of the numbers.
Let's call that xor-sum of everything else $y$.

Since the xor-sum is $0$, $x_1=y$. Removing any number of sticks from $x_1$ will
break this equality and turn $x_1 \oplus y$ nonzero, which is precisely the
definition for our winning state.

#### Winning $\rightarrow$ Losing

Now we have to prove that any _winning_ state can move to a losing state for the
other player. Notice the use of _can_ instead of _will_ in our statement due to
how these games work.

This time, let's define $y$ as the xor-sum of _all_ the piles instead of all
except for one. Then, say we have an $x_i$ such that $x_i > y \oplus x_i$. Note
that $y \oplus x_i$ is the xor-sum of all the other elements, since XOR is its
own inverse.

With this, we can take $x_i - (y \oplus x_i)$ sticks from $x_i$, then makes it
equivalent to $y \oplus x_i$ and the xor-sum of the whole board will be $0$,
thus forming a losing state for the second player.

But all of this hinges on the existence of an $x_i$ such that
$x_i > y \oplus x_i$. Does it _always_ exist?

Suppose that $p$ is the position of the most significant bit in $y$. Then, we
know that there must exist some $x_i$ with a set bit at $p$ as well. Whether $p$
is the most significant bit in $x_i$ or not, XOR-ing the two gives a result with
a $0$ at bit $p$. This then guarantees that there exists an
$x_i > y \oplus x_i$.

<center>

| Variable       | Value         |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| $y$            | `0...01?...?` |
| $x_i$          | `?...?1?...?` |
| $y \oplus x_i$ | `?...?0?...?` |

_Since the first part of $y$ is all `0`s, the first parts of $x_i$ and
$y \oplus x_i$ are the same._

<Optional title="What if we could add?">

In some cases, players may be allowed to add sticks as well as remove them.
Funnily enough, this doesn't change how the winning and losing states are
determined, i.e. the outcome of the game.

## Sprague-Grundy theorem

Before we get into this theorem, we first have to define what "nimbers"
(sometimes referred to as "grundy values") are. Each nimber — say 0, 3, or 4 —
represents a one-pile game of Nim with that many stones. Notice that for any
positive nimber, the first player always wins since they can take all the stones
from the pile and leave none for the second. On the other hand, the nimber 0 is
a losing state, since the first player can't take any more stones.

What the
[Sprague-Grundy theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem)
allows us to do is to reduce the state of certain types of games into a nimber.

The way we do this is with a recursive definition. If we can compute the nimbers
of all states $r_i$ reachable from a certain state $s$, then $s$ itself can be
reduced to the nimber

$$
n(s)=\text{mex}(r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_k)
$$

For convenience, we have defined $n$ as the function that reduces game states to
nimbers.

The $\text{mex}$ function takes a list of numbers and returns the biggest
non-negative integer that is _not_ included in the list. Notice that the name is
a portmanteau of "max" and "excluded".

### One-pile Example

Let's take a look at an altered version case of Nim. Here's there's only one
pile, but each player can only remove 1, 2, or 3 stones.

According to the theorem, the nimber value is the $\text{mex}$ of the reachable
nimber value. In the case of this game, each state can reach the previous $3$
values because we can only remove 1, 2 or 3 stones in one move.

Here's how the values are computed:

- $n(0) = 0$
- $n(1) = \text{mex}(0) = 1$
- $n(2) = \text{mex}(0, 1) = 2$
- $n(3) = \text{mex}(0, 1, 2) = 3$
- $n(4) = \text{mex}(1, 2, 3) = 0$
- $n(5) = \text{mex}(2, 3, 0) = 1$
- $n(6) = \text{mex}(3, 0, 1) = 2$
- $n(7) = \text{mex}(0, 1, 2) = 3$

This gives us the following table of nimber values:

Here's the table of nimber values:

![Nimber table](./assets/nim.png)

All nimber reductions that are equal to 0 are losing states; see $n(0)$ and
$n(4)$.

Recall that a winning state means that you can put the other player in a losing
state. On the other hand, a losing state means that every move results in a
winning state for the opponent. For example, $n(4)=0$ because $1$, $2$, and $3$
are winning. Similarly, $n(8) = 0$, because we can't reach $4$ in a single move.

### Multiple-pile Example

How about we try reducing multiple-pile Nim games with this theorem?

We know that a state is a losing state if the xor-sum is 0. This matches up
exactly with how our nimbers work, as the 0 nimber represents a losing state.

Thus, to reduce a Nim game of multiple piles to a nimber, we can take the
xor-sum of the nimbers of the single piles. Notice that the nimber of only one
pile is the size of the pile.

This is
[equivalent to the formula using mex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber#Addition),
but a proof of that is beyond the scope of this module. We merely try to give
some intuition for why this is true.

$$
n([p_1, \cdots, p_n])=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n n(p_i)
$$

This xor-sum reduction can be extended to more things than just Nim. If we can
decompose a game into multiple disjoint parts where one player makes a chooses a
subgame then makes a move, then the nimbers of these games can be combined with
the xor-sum.

## Applications

### S-NIM

<FocusProblem problem="snim" />

#### Explanation

We can compute the nimber values of each pile with the mex definition and then
combine them using the XOR operator.

#### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(PK+ML)$, where $P$ is the maximum pile size.

### Chessboard Game, Again!

<FocusProblem problem="chessboard-games" />

#### Explanation

Here we see a case of using the xor-sum to combine things that aren't straight
Nim games.

In this problem, we can decompose each game into a bunch of subgames, where each
subgame is a single coin. Players choose the subgame (coin) and then make a
move.

We first apply the mex formula to calculate nimbers for individual coins, and
then combine them at the end with a xor-sum

#### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(TK)$, since the board is constant size.

#include <iostream>

/** @return The nimber value of a coin at a single position. */
int nimber(int r, int c) {
	static std::map<std::pair<int, int>, int> cache;
	if (cache.count({r, c})) { return cache[{r, c}]; }

	if (r < 0 || BOARD_LEN <= r || c < 0 || BOARD_LEN <= c) {
		return -1;  // return -1 to not interfere with the mex operations
	}

	std::set<int> reachable{nimber(r - 2, c + 1), nimber(r - 2, c - 1),
	                        nimber(r + 1, c - 2), nimber(r - 1, c - 2)};

	int ret = 0;
	while (reachable.count(ret)) { ret++; }

	return cache[{r, c}] = ret;

	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) {

		std::cin >> coin_num;
		for (int i = 0; i < coin_num; i++) {
			int r, c;
			std::cin >> r >> c;
			coin_xor ^= nimber(r - 1, c - 1);
