Note: This was originally in Gold, but the practice problems were too hard ...

<FocusProblem problem="sample" />

<br />

To solve this problem, we need a data structure that supports operations similar
to the following:

1. Add a pair $(a,b)$.
2. For any $x$, query the maximum value of $b$ over all pairs satisfying
   $a\ge x$.

This can be solved with a segment tree, but a simpler option is to use a map. We
rely on the fact that if there exist pairs $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ in the map such
that $a\le c$ and $b\le d$, we can simply ignore $(a,b)$ (and the answers to
future queries will not be affected). So at every point in time, the pairs
$(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),\ldots,(a_k,b_k)$ that we store in the map will satisfy
$a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_k$ and $b_1 > b_2 > \cdots > b_k$.

- Querying for a certain $x$ can be done with a single `lower_bound` operation,
  as we just want the minimum $i$ such that $a_i\ge x$.
- When adding a pair $(a',b')$, first check if there exists $(a,b)$ already in
  the map such that $a\ge a', b\ge b'$.
  - If so, then do nothing.
  - Otherwise, insert $(a',b')$ into the map and repeatedly delete pairs $(a,b)$
    such that $a\le a', b\le b'$ from the map until none remain.

If there are $N$ insertions, then each query takes $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time
and adding a pair takes $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time amortized.

### Implementation

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#define lb lower_bound

map<int, ll> m;
void ins(int a, ll b) {
	auto it = m.lb(a);
	if (it != end(m) && it->s >= b) return;
	it = m.insert(it, {a, b});
	it->s = b;
	while (it != begin(m) && prev(it)->s <= b) m.erase(prev(it));
}
ll query(int x) {
	auto it = m.lb(x);
	return it == end(m) ? 0 : it->s;
}
// it = end(m) means that no pair satisfies a >= x
```
