In this section I will briefly walk over my understanding of min cost flow. I
would highly recommend reading through
[CP-Algorithm's Min Cost Flow](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/min_cost_flow.html)
to understand the solution idea first. Additionally, check the
[TopCoder tutorial](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/minimum-cost-flow-part-two-algorithms/)
for a more detailed explanation.

## Triangle Inequality

In graph theory, the **Triangle Inequality** states that if there is an edge
$u \rightarrow v$ with weight $w$, and $d_k$ be the shortest path to node $k$
(for some reasonable definition of shortest path), then $d_v - d_u \leq w$.

## Johnson's Algorithm

The main idea of **Johnson's Algorithm** is that if all edge weights are
positive, then running Dijkstra's from each node would result in a
$\mathcal{O}(VE \log E)$ algorithm. If there are any negative edges, **Johnson's
Algorithm** defines a potential function $\pi$, such that for every edge
$u,v,w$, the following holds: $w>=\pi(u)-\pi(v)$. Then, each edge weight can be
transformed into $w \rightarrow w + \pi(v)-\pi(u)$, resulting in positive
weight. This condition coincides with the **Triangle Inequality**, so we can
arbitrarily pick a node and run a $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ shortest path algorithm to
determine this function.

## Minimum Cost Flow

The general idea of Min Cost Flow is to repeatedly push flow along the shortest
path. Since flow graphs have negative edges, each step naively would take
$\mathcal{O}(VE)$ time. To speed it up, we can use the same potential function
from **Johnson's Algorithm** to employ Dijkstra for this process. In this case
we _must_ use distance from $S$, the source node, as the $\pi$ function. At each
step, run Dijkstra's using the $\pi$ function, update the $\pi$ function to
match the current distances, and then push flow along the shortest path,
reversing edges as needed. Once flow is met or the sink is unreachable,
terminate.

<Info title="Important Clarification">

Note that the $\pi$ function stores values _before_ the edge reverses happen.
Luckily the **triangle inequality**'s equality case is along the shortest path,
meaning that in a flow network it holds both forwards and backwards along edges
in the shortest path. This means that although the $\pi$ function does not store
the shortest paths, it still satisfies the **triangle inequality** for all
edges.

$\pi(u)-\pi(v)=w \implies \pi(v)-\pi(u)=-w$

## Implementation

With all this being said, here is my implementation.

<!-- Confirmed Here: https://codeforces.com/contest/818/submission/82266882 -->

```cpp
template<int MN, int MM>
struct MCF//MN = nodes, MM = edges [assume edges one-directional]
{
public:
	int N, M, S, T;
	int flow[MM*2], cap[MM*2], hd[MN], nx[MM*2], to[MM*2], cost[MM*2];
	int pi[MN], p[MN], d[MN];
	int vis[MN];
	void init(int n, int s, int t)
	{
		N=n, S=s, T=t;
		memset(hd, -1, sizeof hd);
	}
	void adde1(int a, int b, int f, int c)
	{
		nx[M]=hd[a], hd[a]=M;
		to[M]=b, cost[M]=c, cap[M]=f;
		M++;
	}
	void adde(int a, int b, int f, int c)
	{
		adde1(a, b, f, c);
		adde1(b, a, 0, -c);
	}
	void setpi()
	{
		std::queue<int> q;
		memset(pi, 0x3e, sizeof pi);
		memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
		q.push(S);
		pi[S] = 0;
		for(int n;!q.empty();)
		{
			n = q.front(); q.pop();
			for(int id=hd[n],x;~id;id=nx[id])
			{
				if(cap[id] - flow[id] <= 0) continue;
				x = to[id];
				if(ckmin(pi[x], pi[n]+cost[id]))
					assert(++vis[x] <= N), q.push(x);
			}
		}
	}
	struct state
	{
	public:
		int n, d;
		bool operator > (state o) const {return d > o.d;}
	};
	void dijk()
	{
		std::priority_queue<state, std::vector<state>, std::greater<state> > q;
		memset(p, -1, N * sizeof p[0]);
		memset(vis, 0, N * sizeof vis[0]);
		memset(d, 0x3e, N * sizeof d[0]);

		d[S] = 0;
		q.push({S, 0});
		for(int n;!q.empty();)
		{
			n = q.top().n; q.pop();
			if(vis[n]) continue;
			vis[n]=1;
			for(int id=hd[n],x,w;~id;id=nx[id])
			{
				if(cap[id] - flow[id] <= 0) continue;
				x = to[id];
				w = cost[id] + pi[n] - pi[x];
				if(ckmin(d[x], w+d[n]))
					p[x]=id, q.push({x, d[x]});
			}
		}
	}
	int mincost(int F)
	{
		setpi();
		int C=0;
		while(F>0)
		{
			dijk();
			if(d[T] == INF)
				return INF;
			int c = d[T] + pi[T] - pi[S], f = F;
			for(int x=T;x!=S;x=to[p[x]^1])
				ckmin(f, cap[p[x]]-flow[p[x]]);
			C += c*f;
			for(int x=T;x!=S;x=to[p[x]^1])
			{
				flow[p[x]  ] += f;
				flow[p[x]^1] -= f;
			}
			F -= f;
			for(int i=0;i<N;++i)
				pi[i] += d[i];
		}
		return C;
	}
};
