Suppose you want to support the following queries:

- Given a range l, r count number of occurrences of value x.
- Given a range l, r find the k smallest element

With wavelet tree you can easily support those queries in log(n) time.

<Info title="Additional information">
  It is possible to support with updates in $\mathcal{O}(\log n^2)$
</Info>

## Wavelet Tree Structure

A wavelet tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of values.  
The root node covers the entire range, and each subsequent level splits the
range into two halves.

## First lets define our Data Structures

We are going to maintain a segment tree over values instead of indices.  
Each segment contains indices whose values lie within the segment's range.  
Let's save those indicies in a vector.  
Notice that a index can be in at most log(N) segments

<Spoiler title="Wavelet tree Visualization">

Lets say our array is: [3,5,3,1,2,2,3,4,5,5]

## Solving the First Type of Query (Given a range l, r count number of occurrences of value x.)

To calculate the number of occurrences from 𝑙 to 𝑟, we can use the following
formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
occurrences(l, r) = occurrences(r) - occurrences(l)
\end{aligned}
$$

This reduces the problem to counting the number of occurrences in a prefix.

### Approaching the Solution

One way to solve the problem is to go to the leaf node  
and perform a binary search for the number of indices less than 𝑟  
However, let's explore a different approach that can also be extended to the
second type of query.

### A different way to find the Index of 𝑟 in the list of Vertices

Instead of binary searching on the leaf, we update 𝑟 as we recurse down the
tree.  
If we are able to determine the position (index) of 𝑟 in the left and right
children of a node  
We can recurse down the tree and determine its position in the leaf node.

### Determining the Position in Child Nodes

To find the position of 𝑟 in a node's left and right children, we need to
determine how many indices are smaller than the middle value (mid) and precede
𝑟.  
This can be done using a prefix sum.

Let's define:  
c[i] = as 1 if index[i] is smaller than mid otherwise 0  
prefixB[i] as prefix sum of c[i]

Formally

$$
c[i] = index[i] < mid ? 1 : 0;
prefixB[i] = prefixB[i - 1] + c[i]
$$

### Updating 𝑟 as We Recurse

To know the value of 𝑟 if we recurse left, we use prefixB[r]  
If we recurse right, we use 𝑟 - prefixB[r]

## Solving the second type of query (Given a range l, r find the k smallest element)

We will determine whether the answer for a given node is in the left or the
right segment.  
We can calculate how many times the elements within the segments' ranges appear
in our range (l, r) using our first type of query.  
Note that this also works for non-leaf nodes using the following formula:

$$
occurrences(l, r) = r - l
$$
<Info title="Simular">
This is simular to counting how many times a value appears up to index 𝑅 in our previous query. We did this by using the new 𝑅 value at the leaf node. But now, we consider the difference between the updated 𝑅 and 𝐿
</Info>

Therefore, the occurrences of the left node is

$$
left_occurrences = prefixB[r] - prefixB[l]
$$

<Info title="Left occurrences">
  Note that left_occurrences is the amount of indices between l and r that their value is less than mid  

</Info>

- If left_occurrences left_occurrences is greater or equal to k, it means the k-th smallest element is in
  the left subtree. Therefore, we update our range and recurse into the left
  child
- If left_occurrences is less than k, it means the
  k-th smallest element is in the right subtree. We adjust k by subtracting
  left_occurrences from k, update our range, and recurse into the right child

<Info title="Notice">
  Notice we still update l, r accordingly when we go left or right
</Info>

the answer then will be the value of the node we end up on (leaf)

## implemention

<CPPSection>

```cpp
struct Segment {
    Segment *left = nullptr, *right = nullptr;
    int l, r, mid;
    bool children = false;
    vector<pair<int,int>> indices; // Index, Value
    vector<int> prefixB;

    Segment(int l, int r, vector<pair<int,int>> indices) :l(l), r(r), mid((r + l) / 2), indices(std::move(indices)) {
        calculateB();
    }

    void update() {
        if (children) return;
        children = true;
        if (r - l > 1) {
            // Split the indices for left and right child
            vector<pair<int,int>> leftIndices, rightIndices;
            for (auto [ind, val] : indices)
                if (val < mid)
                    leftIndices.emplace_back(ind,val);
                else
                    rightIndices.emplace_back(ind,val);


            left = new Segment(l,mid, leftIndices);
            right = new Segment(mid,r, rightIndices);
        }
    }

    // Calculates the prefix B
    void calculateB() {
        int i = 1;
        int j = 0;
        prefixB.resize(indices.size() + 1);
        for (auto [ind, val] : indices) {
            if (val < mid) j++;
            prefixB[i++] = j;
        }
    }

    int findKSmallest(int a, int b, int k) {
        update();
        if (r - l <= 1) return l;

        int lb = prefixB[a];
        int lr = prefixB[b];
        int inLeft = lr - lb;

        if (k <= inLeft) return left->findKSmallest(lb,lr,k);
        else return right->findKSmallest(a - lb,b - lr, k - inLeft);
    }
};
```

## Supporting updates

Lets support updates of type:
	- change value at index i to y 

What we can do is recurse down to your leaf in order to remove the old element. And also recurse down to add the new element.

So what do the updates change?   
 - 
 Our indicies vector
 Our prefix vector

### Changing the indicies vector
What we can do is instead of storing a vector use a set.   
Then erasing and adding values becomes easy.

### Changing the prefix vector
Since each update could change our prefix vector a lot, we cant maintain just he normal vector.   
What we could do use use a sparse segment tree.   
	- erasing and inserting can be done by just setting the value to 0 or 1 at the specific index
	- quering for a prefix can be done by quering the segment tree from 0 till i
This approach is not really memory effient and also requires the implemention of a segment tree.  
A more friendly approach would be using an order statistics tree.
