# Wavelet Tree
Wavelet trees are data structures that support efficient queries for the k-th minimum element in a range by maintaining a segment tree over values instead of indices.

Suppose you want to support the following queries:

- Given a range, count the number of occurrences of value $x$.
- Given a range, find the $k$ smallest element

With a wavelet tree, you can easily support those queries in $\log(M)$ time,
where $M$ is the maximum value in the array.

## Wavelet tree structure

A wavelet tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of values.
The root node covers the entire range, and each subsequent level splits the
range into two halves.

We are going to maintain a segment tree over values instead of indices. Each segment will contain indices whose values lie within the segment's range. We'll save those indices in a vector. Notice that an index can be in at most $log(M)$ segments

<Spoiler title="Wavelet tree Visualization">

Let's say our array is: $[3,5,3,1,2,2,3,4,5,5]$
Each node has an array representing the indecies of every number between l and r

## Solving the first type of query
**Given a range l, r count the number of occurrences of value x.**

To calculate the number of occurrences from $𝑙$ to $𝑟$, we can use the following
formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{occurrences}(l, r) = \texttt{occurrences}(r) - \texttt{occurrences}(l)
\end{aligned}
$$

This reduces the problem to counting the number of occurrences in a prefix.

One way to solve the problem is to go to the leaf node
and perform a binary search for the number of indices less than $𝑟$
However, let's explore a different approach that can also be extended to the
second type of query.

**A different way to find the Index of $𝑟$ in the list of vertices**

Instead of binary searching on the leaf, we update $𝑟$ as we recurse down the
tree.
If we can determine the position (index) of $𝑟$ in the left and right
children of a node.
We can recurse down the tree and determine its position in the leaf node.

To find the position of $𝑟$ in a node's left and right children, we need to
determine how many indices are smaller than the middle value (mid) and precede
$𝑟$.
This can be done using a prefix sum.

Let's define:
- $c[i]$ = as 1 if $index[i]$ is smaller than mid otherwise 0
- $prefixB[i]$ as prefix sum of $c[i]$

Formally

$$
c[i] = index[i] < mid ? 1 : 0;
prefixB[i] = prefixB[i - 1] + c[i]
$$


To update $r$ as we recurse down, we do the following:
- To know the value of 𝑟 if we recurse left, we use prefixB[r]
- If we recurse right, we use 𝑟 - prefixB[r]

## Solving the second type of query
**Given a range l, r find the k smallest element**

We will determine whether the answer for a given node is in the left or the
right segment.
We can calculate how many times the elements within the segments' ranges appear
in our range $(l, r)$ using our first type of query.
Note that this also works for non-leaf nodes using the following formula:

$$
\texttt{occurrences}(l, r) = r - l
$$
<Info title="Simular">
This is similar to counting how many times a value appears up to index 𝑅 in our previous query. We did this by using the new 𝑅 value at the leaf node. But now, we consider the difference between the updated 𝑅 and 𝐿
</Info>

Therefore, the occurrences of the left node is

$$
\texttt{left\_occurrences} = prefixB[r] - prefixB[l]
$$

<Info title="Left occurrences">
  Note that $\texttt{left\_occurrences}$ is the number of indices between l and r whose value is less than mid

</Info>

- If $\texttt{left\_occurrences}$ is greater or equal to $k$, it means the $k$-th smallest element is in
  the left subtree. Therefore, we update our range and recurse into the left
  child
- If $\texttt{left\_occurrences}$ is less than $k$, it means the
  $k$-th smallest element is in the right subtree. We adjust k by subtracting
  $\texttt{left\_occurrences}$ from $k$, update our range, and recurse into the right child

<Info title="Notice">
  Notice we still update $l, r$ accordingly when we go left or right
</Info>

the answer then will be the value of the node we end up on (leaf)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

struct Segment {
	Segment *left = nullptr, *right = nullptr;
	int l, r, mid;
	bool children = false;
	vector<pair<int, int>> indices;  // Index, Value
	vector<int> prefix_b;

	Segment(int l, int r, const vector<pair<int, int>> &indices)
	    : l(l), r(r), mid((r + l) / 2), indices(indices) {
		calculate_b();
	}

	// Sparse since values can go up to 1e9
	void update() {
		if (children) { return; }
		children = true;
		if (r - l > 1) {
			// Split the indices for left and right child
			vector<pair<int, int>> leftIndices, rightIndices;
			partition_copy(indices.begin(), indices.end(), leftIndices.begin(),
			               rightIndices.begin(), [this](const pair<int, int> &elem) {
				               return elem.second < mid;
			               });

			left = new Segment(l, mid, leftIndices);
			right = new Segment(mid, r, rightIndices);
		}
	}

	// Calculates the prefix B
	void calculate_b() {
		int i = 1;
		int j = 0;
		prefix_b.resize(indices.size() + 1);
		for (auto [ind, val] : indices) {
			if (val < mid) j++;
			prefix_b[i++] = j;
		}
	}

	int find_k_smallest(int a, int b, int k) {
		update();
		if (r - l <= 1) { return l; }

		int lb = prefix_b[a];
		int lr = prefix_b[b];
		int inLeft = lr - lb;  // Amount of values in range (a,b) that are less the mid

		if (k <= inLeft) {
			return left->find_k_smallest(lb, lr, k);  // Appears in left
		} else {
			return right->find_k_smallest(a - lb, b - lr,
			                              k - inLeft);  // Appears in right
		}
	}
};

int main() {
	int n, q;
	cin >> n >> q;

	vector<pair<int, int>> indices;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		int v;
		cin >> v;
		indices.emplace_back(i, v);
	}
	Segment seg(0, 1e9 + 2, indices);

	for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
		int a, b, k;
		cin >> a >> b >> k;
		k++;
		cout << seg.find_k_smallest(a, b, k) << " ";

## Supporting updates

Let's support updates of type:
	- change value at index $i$ to $y$

We can traverse down to the leaf to remove the old element and also traverse down to add the new element.

So what do the updates change?
 -
 Our indices vector
 Our prefix vector

To change the indices vector, what we can do is, instead of storing a vector, use a set.
Then erasing and adding values becomes easy.

On the other hand, To change the prefix vector, since each update could change our prefix vector a lot, we can't maintain just the normal vector. What we could do is use a sparse segment tree.
	- erasing and inserting can be done by just setting the value to 0 or 1 at the specific index
	- querying for a prefix can be done by querying the segment tree from 0 to $i$
This approach is not memory efficient and requires a segment tree's implementation.
A more friendly approach would be using an order statistics tree.
Such that querying for a prefix would be equivalent to order_of_key($i$)
