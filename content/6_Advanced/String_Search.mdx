# Single String

## KMP

**Knuth-Morris-Pratt**, or **KMP**, is a linear time string comparison algorithm
that matches prefixes. Specifically, it computes the longest substring that is
both a prefix and suffix of a string, and it does so for every prefix of a given
string.

## Z Algorithm

The **Z-Algorithm** is another linear time string comparison algorithm like KMP,
but instead finds the longest common prefix of a string and all of its suffixes.

# Palindromes

## Manacher

<FocusProblem problem="manacherFocus" />

**Manacher's Algorithm** functions similarly to the **Z-Algorithm**. It
determines the longest palindrome centered at each character.

<Info title="Don't Forget!">
	If s[l, r] is a palindrome, then s[l+1, r-1] is as well.

## Palindromic Tree

A **Palindromic Tree** is a tree-like data structure that behaves similarly to
KMP. Unlike KMP, in which the only empty state is $0$, the Palindromic Tree has
two empty states: length $0$, and length $-1$. This is because appending a
character to a palindrome increases the length by $2$, meaning a single
character palindrome must have been created from a palindrome of length $-1$

# Multiple Strings

## Tries

A **trie** is a tree-like data structure that stores strings. Each node is a
string, and each edge is a character. The root is the empty string, and every
node is represented by the characters along the path from the root to that node.
This means that every prefix of a string is an ancestor of that string's node.

## Aho-Corasick

**Aho-Corasick** is the combination of **trie** and **KMP**. It is essentially a
trie with KMP's "fail" array.

<Warning>

Build the entire trie first, and then run a _BFS_ to construct the fail array.

</Warning>
