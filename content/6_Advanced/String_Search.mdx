# Single String

<Info title="A Note on Notation:">

For a string $S$:
- $|S|$ denotes the size of string $S$
- $S[i]$ denotes the character at index $i$ starting from $0$
- $S[l:r]$ denotes the substring beginning at index $l$ and ending at index $r$
- $S[:r]$ is equivalent to $S[0:r]$, represents the prefix ending at $r$
- $S[l:]$ is equivalent to $S[l:|S| - 1]$, represents the suffix beginning of $l$.
- $S + T$ denotes concactinating $T$ to the end of $S$. Note that this implies that addition is **non-commutative**.

Define an array $\pi_S$ of size $|S|$ such that $\pi_S[i]$ is equal to the length of the longest nontrivial suffix of the prefix ending at position $i$ that coincides with a prefix of the entire string. Formally,

$$
\pi_S[i] = \max \{k \: | \: 1 \leq k < i \text{ and } S[0:k - 1] \equiv S[i - (k - 1): i] \}
$$

In other words, for a given index $i$, we would like to compute the length of the longest substring that ends at $i$, such that this string also happens to be a prefix of the *entire* string. One such string that satisfies this criteria is the prefix ending at $i$; we will be disregarding this solution for obvious reasons.

For instance, for $S = \text{``abcabcd"}$, $\pi_S = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0]$, and the prefix function of $S = \text{``aabaaab"}$ is $\pi_S = [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3]$. In the second example, $\pi_S[4] = 2$ because the prefix of length $2$ ($\text{``ab"})$ is equivalent to the substring of length $2$ that ends at index $4$. In the same way, $\pi_S[6] = 3$ because the prefix of length $3$ ($\text{``abb"}$) is equal to the substring of length $3$ that ends at index $6$. For both of these samples, there is no longer substring that satisfies these criteria.

The purpose of the KMP algorithm is to efficiently compute the $\pi_S$ array in linear time. Suppose we have already computed the $\pi_S$ array for indices $0\dots i$, and need to compute the value for index $i + 1$.

Firstly, note that between $\pi_S[i]$ and $\pi_S[i + 1]$, $\pi_S[i + 1]$ can be at most one greater. This occurs when $S[\pi_S[i]] = S[i + 1]$.

![KMP Example 1](./kmp_example1.png)

In the example above, $\pi_S[i] = 5$, meaning that the suffix of length $5$ is equivalent to a prefix of length $5$ of the entire string. It follows that if the character at position $5$ of the string is equal to the character at position $i + 1$, then the match is simply extended by a single character. Thus, $\pi_S[i + 1] = \pi_S[i] + 1 = 6$.

In the general case, however, this is not necessarily true. That is to say, $S[\pi_S[i]] \neq S[i + 1]$. Thus, we need to find the largest index $j < \pi_S[i]$ such that the prefix property holds (ie $S[:j - 1] \equiv S[i - j + 1:i]$). For such a length $j$, we repeat the procedure in the first example by comparing characters at indices $j$ and $i + 1$: if the two are equal, then we can conclude our search and assign $\pi_S[i + 1] = j + 1$, and otherwise, we find the next smallest $j$ and repeat. Indeed, notice that the first example is simply the case where $j$ begins as $\pi_S[i]$.

![KMP Example 2](./kmp_example2.png)

In the second example above, we let $j = 2$.

The only thing that remains is to be able to efficiently find all the $j$ that we might possibly need. To recap, if the position we're currently at is $j$, to handle transitions we need to find the largest index $k$ that satisfies the prefix property $S[:k - 1] \equiv S[j - k + 1 : j]$. Since $j < i$, this value is simply $\pi_S[j - 1]$, a value that has already been computed. All that remains is to handle the case where $j = 0$. If $S[0] = S[i + 1]$, $\pi_S[i + 1] = 1$, otherwise $\pi_S[i + 1] = 0$.

**Claim:** The KMP algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for computing the $\pi_S$ array on a string $S$ of length $n$.

**Proof:** Note that $j$ doesn't actually change through multiple iterations. This is because on iteration $i$, we assign $j = \pi_S[i - 1]$. However, in the previous iteration, we assign $\pi_S[i - 1]$ to be $j$. Furthermore, note that $j$ is always non-negative. In each iteration of $i$, $j$ is only increased by at most $1$ in the if statement. Since $j$ remains non-negative and is only increased a constant amount per iteration, it follows that $j$ can only decrease by at most $n$ times through all iterations of $i$. Since the inner loop is completely governed by $j$, the overall complexity amortizes to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. $\blacksquare$

## Z Algorithm

<FocusProblem problem="finding-periods" />

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="cp-algo"
		title="Z Function"

	 />
	<Resource source="CPH" title="26.4 - Z-algorithm" />
	<Resource source="CF" title="Z Algorithm" url="3107" />
</Resources>

### Explanation

The Z-algorithm is very similar to KMP, but it uses a different function than $\pi$ and it has an interesting different application than string matching.

Instead of using $\pi$, it uses the **z-function**.
Given a position, this function gives the length of the longest string that's both the prefix of $S$
and of the suffix of $S$ starting at the given position.

Here's some examples of what this function might look like:
- `aabxaayaab` $\rightarrow$ $Z=[10,1,0,0,2,1,0,3,1,0]$
- `aabxaabxcaabxaabxay` $\rightarrow$ $Z=[18,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,5,1,0,0,1,0]$

Let's also take a closer look at $Z_9=8$ (0-indexed) for the second string.
The value for this position is $8$ because that's the longest common prefix
between the string itself **aabxaabxcaabx**aabxay and the suffix starting
at position $9$ **aabxaabx**ay (also 0-indexed).

To efficiently compute this array, we maintain the $[l, r]$ interval such that $S_{l...r}$ is also a prefix, i.e. $Z_l=r-l+1$.

Say we have a position $i$ anywhere in $[l,r]$.
We would then have these two cases:

1. If $i + Z_{i-l} < r$, we know that $Z_i = Z_{i-l}$.
2. Otherwise, $i + Z_{i-l} \geq r$, meaning that the answer can expand beyond $r$.
   Thus, we compare character by character from there on.

**Manacher's Algorithm** functions similarly to the **Z-Algorithm**. It
determines the longest palindrome centered at each character.

Let's denote $dp_i$ as the maximum diameter of a palindrome centered at $i$.
Manacher's algorithm makes use of the previously determined $dp_j$, where $j < i$ incalculating $dp_i$. The main idea is that for a palindrome centered at $i$ with the borders $left$ and $right$ the $dp_j$ ($i < j \le right$) values are - probably - mirrors
of the $dp_k$ ($left \le k < i$) values on the left side of the palindrome.
Probably because for some $j$ the maximum palindrome might cross the right border.
This way the algorithm only considers the palindrome centers that could lead to the expansion of the maximum palindrome.

**Time complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

## Palindromic Tree

A **Palindromic Tree** is a tree-like data structure that behaves similarly to
KMP. Unlike KMP, in which the only empty state is $0$, the Palindromic Tree has
two empty states: length $0$, and length $-1$. This is because appending a
character to a palindrome increases the length by $2$, meaning a single
character palindrome must have been created from a palindrome of length $-1$

A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings. Each node is a string, and each edge is a character.

The root is the empty string, and every node is represented by the characters along the path from the root to that node.
This means that every prefix of a string is an ancestor of that string's node.

The Aho-Corasick algorithm stores the pattern words in a trie structure, described above.
It uses the trie to transition from a state to anoother.
Similar to KMP algorithm, we want to reuse the information we have already processed.

A **suffix link** or **failure link** for a node $u$ is a special edge that points to the longest proper suffix of the string corresponding to node $u$.
The suffix links for the root and all its immediate children point to the root node.
For all other nodes $u$ with parent $p$ and letter $c$ on the edge $p \rightarrow u$ the suffix link
can be computed by following $p$'s failure link and transitioning to letter $c$ from there.

While processing the string $S$ the algorithm maintains the current node in the trie such that word
formed in the node is equal to the longest suffix ending in $i$.

For example, when transitioning from $i$ to $i+1$ in $S$ there only are two choices:
1. If $node$ does have an outgoing edge with letter $S_{i+1}$, then move down the edge.
2. Otherwise, follow the failure link of $S_i$ and transition to letter $S_{i+1}$ from there.

The image below depicts how the structure looks like for the words $[a, ag, c, caa, gag, gc, gca]$.

<i> An Aho-Corasick trie with failure links as light edges. </i>

There is a special case when some words are substring of other words in the wordlist. This could lead to some problems depending on the implementation. [Dictionary links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFKxWFew_L0) can solve this problem.
They act like suffix links that point to the first suffix that is also a word in the wordlist. The code below constructs the structure using a BFS.
