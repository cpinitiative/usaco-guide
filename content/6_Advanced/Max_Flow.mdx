Hopcroft-Karp Bipartite Matching?

<Optional title="Faster Flow">

There exist faster flow algorithms such as **Push-Relabel**. Also see the
following blog post:

- [Chilli: Dinic's with Scaling](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66006)

However, the standard implementation of Dinic's is (almost) always fast enough
on reasonable problems.
