In this module, we assume that "interactive" means problems that allow a limited
number of queries and "communication" means problems about communicating between
two separate programs.

## Interactive Problems

### Tip 1 - Exploit the Limits

Since almost all interactive problems have a limit on the number of queries you
may ask, you should use that limit to guide your thinking. There's no point in
trying to come up with a solution that uses $\log N$ queries when the limit is
$N^2$!

There are three types of interactive problems:

1. Problems that directly tell you the target complexity of your solution (e.g.
   IOI 2014 Rail).
2. Problems that only tell you the maximum number of queries you may use (e.g.
   IOI 2013 Cave).
3. Problems that have a hidden limit on the number of queries (e.g. IOI 2015
   Scales).

The first type is nice because we get an idea of what our solution should look
like.

The second type is slightly less nice, but we can still approximate the target
complexity (e.g. $N = 5000$ and $Q = 70000 \implies N \log N$ queries).

The third type is the least nice, but fortunately, we can sometimes still figure
out the hidden limit. For example, in problems with relative scoring (like IOI
2015 Scales), we can submit a solution that uses a fixed number of queries for
each input and then reverse-engineer the limit from our score.

### Tip 2 - Divide and Conquer

In most interactive problems, the solution is to **divide and conquer**. This is
usually either binary search ($\log N$ queries) or something like merge sort
($N \log N$ queries)

Whenever you see large input limits and small query limits, you should
immediately think of binary search.

<FocusProblem problem="interactiveDnC" />

In this problem, we have $N = 512$ and $Q \leq 9$. Notice how $2^9 = 512$ - this
suggests that we should binary search.

Indeed, that's the solution - try to come up with it yourself!

<Spoiler title="Solution">

The solution is to binary search on the DFS order of the tree for the largest
prefix without an easter egg. This works because any prefix of the DFS order is
a connected component.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include "grader.h"
using namespace std;

vector<int> graph[513], ord;

void dfs(int node = 1, int parent = 0) {
	ord.push_back(node);
	for (int i : graph[node]) if (i != parent) dfs(i, node);
}

int findEgg(int N, vector<pair<int, int>> bridges) {
	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) graph[i].clear();
	ord.clear();
	for (pair<int, int> i : bridges) {
		graph[i.first].push_back(i.second);
		graph[i.second].push_back(i.first);
	}
	dfs();
	int l = 0, r = N - 1;
	while (l != r) {
		int mid = (l + r + 1) / 2;
		if (query(vector<int>(ord.begin(), ord.begin() + mid))) r = mid - 1;
		else l = mid;
	}
	return ord[l];
}
```

## Communication Problems

### Tip 1 - Don't Send Everything

Don't worry about not being able to send all the available information - in most
cases, you shouldn't be able to!

<FocusProblem problem="communicationCareLess" />

In this problem, we're asked to store and compare an integer with several other
integers.

Since these numbers can go up to $2^{12} - 1$, we can't just naively store and
access $A$ (since that would take 24 operations).

Luckily, we can still store sufficient information about $A$ - just not in
binary!

<Spoiler title="Solution">

Here's how our algorithm works:

- Consider $A$ and $B$ in base 4
- First, encode each prefix of $A$ **(6 operations)**
- Next, binary search for the longest common prefix $P$ of $A$ and $B$ **(3
  operations)**
  - If this prefix is of length 6, $A = B$
- Otherwise, consider the digit $d$ directly after this prefix for $B$:
  - If $d > 1$, then we only need to check whether $4P + 3$ is encoded
  - Otherwise, we only need to check whether $4P$ is encoded
  - Check whether it is and return the answer **(1 operation)**

This algorithm uses only 10 operations instead of our original 24 - a
significant improvement!

```cpp
#include "cmp.h"

int delta[6]{1, 4097, 5121, 5377, 5441, 5457};

void remember(int n) {
	for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) bit_set((n >> i * 2) + delta[i]);
}

int compare(int b) {
	int l = 0, r = 6;
	while (l != r) {
		int mid = (l + r) / 2;
		if (bit_get((b >> mid * 2) + delta[mid])) r = mid;
		else l = mid + 1;
	}

	if (!l) return 0;
	int last_digit = (b >> l * 2 - 2) & 3;
	if (last_digit > 1) {
		if (bit_get((((b >> l * 2) << 2) + 3) + delta[l - 1])) return -1;
		return 1;
	} else {
		if (bit_get(((b >> l * 2) << 2) + delta[l - 1])) return 1;
		return -1;
	}
}
```

### Tip 2 - Brute Force

Sometimes, the amount of information that we can send is (slightly) more than
the amount of information we need to decode.

In this case, we can simply map each piece of information we want to decode to a
piece of information that we can send.

<FocusProblem problem="communicationPermutations" />

In this problem, we want to encode and decode an array of 64 integers less than
256 using an unordered sequence of 320 integers less than 256.

The number of arrays of 64 integers less than 256 is slightly less than the
number of increasing sequences of 320 integers less than 256, so we can just map
each array to an increasing sequence (using bignums) and send that sequence.

### Tip 3 - XOR

XOR has a nice property where $A \oplus B \oplus A = B$. This lets us solve many
problems where the data sent is corrupted or the receiver doesn't know what data
the sender sent.

<FocusProblem problem="communicationXOR" />

<Spoiler title="Solution">

Let the XOR-sum of the positions with heads-up coins be $X$. Notice how if we
flip coin $X \oplus c$, then the new XOR-sum of the positions with heads-up coins is
now $c$.

This allows Shahrnaz to determine $c$ after Arnavaz flips exactly 1 coin!

```cpp
#include "coins.h"

std::vector<int> coin_flips(std::vector<int> b, int c) {
	std::vector<int> flips(1);
	int xr = c;
	for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); i++) {
		xr ^= b[i] * i;
	}
	flips[0] = xr;
	return flips;
}

int find_coin(std::vector<int> b) {
	int xr = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); i++) {
		xr ^= b[i] * i;
	}
	return xr;
}
```
