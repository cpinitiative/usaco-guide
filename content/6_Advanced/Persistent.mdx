## Persistent Segment Tree

Persistent segment trees are very similar to sparse segment trees in the sense
that we store child pointers. The key differences are that we have multiple
roots and every time we "update" a node, we actually create a new node in its
place (hence persistence).

### Solution

Since this problem involves range queries, we'll use some type of segment tree
to solve it. (We can also use a Fenwick tree, but that's much harder to make
persistent.)

When dealing with problems involving multiple dimensions, it's often helpful to
view one of those dimensions as time. In this problem, we'll view the index of
each array as its time dimension.

Using a persistent segment tree, we can then turn the problem into the
following:

- Type 1 queries involve a point update on the segment tree at some time.
- Type 2 queries involve a range query on the segment tree at some time.
- Type 3 queries involve copying the root of the segment tree at some time and
  appending it to the array of segment tree roots.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

struct Node {
	ll val;
	Node *l, *r;

	Node(ll x) : val(x), l(nullptr), r(nullptr) {}
	Node(Node *ll, Node *rr) {
		l = ll, r = rr;
		val = 0;
		if (l) val += l->val;
		if (r) val += r->val;
	}
	Node(Node *cp) : val(cp->val), l(cp->l), r(cp->r) {}
};

int n, cnt = 1;
ll a[200001];
Node* roots[200001];

Node* build(int l = 1, int r = n) {
	if (l == r) return new Node(a[l]);
	int mid = (l + r) / 2;
	return new Node(build(l, mid), build(mid + 1, r));
}

Node* update(Node* node, int val, int pos, int l = 1, int r = n) {

	int mid = (l + r) / 2;
	if (pos > mid) return new Node(node->l, update(node->r, val, pos, mid + 1, r));
	else return new Node(update(node->l, val, pos, l, mid), node->r);
}

### Application 1 - Static 2D Range Sums on Large Grids

Persistent segment trees can be used for online 2D static range sum queries in
$\mathcal O(\log N)$ time (think of it like prefix sums).

Note that 2D Fenwick trees with coordinate compression often also work for this
(and are easier to implement), but it's still good to know this application.

### Application 2 - Largest Interval Completely Inside a Range

Consider the following problem:

> Given $N$ intervals on the number line, answer $Q$ queries of the form "what
> is the largest interval completely contained inside the range $[x, y]$?"
>
> $N, Q \leq 10^5$.

Since each interval has two dimensions (i.e. left and right endpoints $l_i$ and
$r_i$), we can view it as a *point* on the number line at $l_i$ with "value"
$r_i - l_i$ that was inserted at time $r_i$.

Now, each query becomes "what is the most valuable point in the range $[x, y]$
that was inserted at or before time $y$?" This is much easier to handle, so we
can solve this problem in $\mathcal O(Q \log N)$ time.
