## Standard Problems

<Warning>

Dealing with edge cases (such as collinear points) can be a pain ...

## Misc Problems

Some European Olympiads, like the CEOI, Balkan OI, and the Croatian OI, tend to
have a lot of geometry problems. These problems tend to be quite difficult as
well, so look for problems there when you run out of problems to practice!
