## Uncategorized Problems

Below we list some problems that we think are roughly Platinum level but don't
really fit in previous modules.<Asterisk>either because there were too many
problems already, or because the problem requires more than one
concept</Asterisk> The difficulties listed here are relative to the Platinum
division (difficulty is subjective and isn't always accurate though). We'll be
expanding this list as we get more problem suggestions.
