## Merging Data Structures

Obviously [linked lists](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/splice/) can be merged in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. But what about sets or vectors?

<FocusProblem problem={problems.sam[0]} />

Let's consider a tree rooted at node $1$, where each node has a color.

For each node, let's store a set containing only that node, and we want to merge the sets in the nodes subtree together such that each node has a set consisting of all colors in the nodes subtree. Doing this allows us to solve a variety of problems, such as query the number of distinct colors in each subtree.

### Naive Solution

Suppose that we want merge two sets $a$ and $b$ of sizes $n$ and $m$, respectively. One possiblility is the following:

```cpp
for (int x: b) a.insert(x);
```

which runs in $\mathcal{O}(m\log (n+m))$ time, yielding a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ in the worst case. If we instead maintain $a$ and $b$ as sorted vectors, we can merge them in $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$ time, but $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ is also too slow.

### Better Solution

With just one additional line of code, we can significantly speed this up.

```cpp
if (a.size() < b.size()) swap(a,b);
for (int x: b) a.insert(x);
```

Note that [swap](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/swap/) exchanges two sets in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. Thus, merging a smaller set of size $m$ into the larger one of size $n$ takes $\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$ time.

**Claim:** The solution runs in $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$ time.

**Proof:** When merging two sets, you move from the smaller set to the larger set. If the size of the smaller set is $X$, then the size of the resulting set is at least $2X$. Thus, an element that has been moved $Y$ times will be in a set of size at least $2^Y$, and since the maximum size of a set is $N$ (the root), each element will be moved at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N$) times.

<Spoiler title="Full Code">

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int MX = 200005;

vector<int> adj[MX]; set<int> col[MX]; long long ans[MX];
void dfs(int v, int p){
    for(int e : adj[v]){
        if(e != p){
           dfs(e, v);
           if(col[v].size() < col[e].size()){
               swap(col[v], col[e]);
           }
           for(int a : col[e]){
               col[v].insert(a);
           }
           col[e].clear();
        }
    }
    ans[v] = col[v].size();
}
int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n; cin >> n;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int x; cin >> x;
        col[i].insert(x);
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
        int u,v; cin >> u >> v;
        u--; v--;
        adj[u].push_back(v); adj[v].push_back(u);
    }
    dfs(0,-1);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        cout << ans[i] << " ";
    }
}
```

## Generalizing

We can also merge other standard library data structures such as `std::map` or `std:unordered_map` in the same way. However, [`std::swap`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/swap) does not always run in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. For example, swapping [`std::array`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/swap/)s takes time linear in the sum of the sizes of the arrays, and the same goes for [GCC policy-based data structures](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/11080) such as `__gnu_pbds::tree` or `__gnu_pbds::gp_hash_table`.

To swap two policy-based data structures `a` and `b` in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, use `a.swap(b)` instead. Note that for standard library data structures, `swap(a,b)` is equivalent to `a.swap(b)`.

## Problems

<Optional title="Faster Merging">

It's easy to merge two sets of sizes $n\ge m$ in $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$ or $(m\log n)$ time, but sometimes $O\left(m\log \left(1+\frac{n}{m}\right)\right)$ can be significantly better than both of these. Check "Advanced - Treaps" for more details. Also see [this link](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/49446) regarding merging segment trees.
