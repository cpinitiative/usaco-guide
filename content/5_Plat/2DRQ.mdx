### Problems

<Problems problems={problems.bit} />

<Optional title="Range Update and Range Query in Higher Dimensions">

Lazy propagation on segment trees does not extend to higher dimensions. However, you can extend the 1D BIT solution to solve range increment range sum in higher dimensions as well! See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6093.pdf) for details.

## 2D Offline Sum Queries

<Problems problems={problems.offSam} />

The intended complexity is $O(N\log^2 N)$ with a good constant factor. This requires updating points and querying rectangle sums $N$ times for points with coordinates in the range $[1,N]$. However, the 2D BITs mentioned above use $O(N^2)$ memory, which is too much.

### Solution - Soriya's Programming Project

Since we know all of the updates and queries beforehand, we can reduce the memory usage while maintaining a decent constant factor.

#### Idea 1: Use an unordered map instead of a 2D array.

Bad idea ... This gives $O(N\log^2N)$ memory and time and the constant factors for both are terrible.

#### Idea 2: Compress the points to be updated so that you only need $O(N\log N)$ memory.

This doesn't require knowing the queries beforehand.

- [my 1D offline BIT](<https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/data-structures/1D%20Range%20Queries%20(9.2)/BIToff.h>)

It's a bit difficult to pass the above problem within the time limit. Make sure to use fast input (and not `endl`)!

- [thecodingwizard's implementation with 2D offline BIT above](https://github.com/thecodingwizard/competitive-programming/blob/master/DMOJ/Soriyas%20Programming%20Project.cpp)

#### Idea 3: Use divide & conquer with a 1D BIT

The fastest way.

## Sparse Segment Tree

### Implementation

<IncompleteSection />

## 2D Segment Tree

Basically a segment tree of (maybe sparse) segment trees (or BBSTs, see "Advanced - Treap").

<Info title="Pro Tip">

This is **not** the same as [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree). If the coordinates go up to $C$, then 2D segment tree queries run in $O(\log^2C)$ time each but some queries make Quadtree take $\Theta(C)$ time!

### Note - Memory Usage

Naively, inserting $N$ elements into a sparse segment tree requires $O(N\log C)$ memory, giving a bound of $O(N\log^2C)$ on 2D segment tree memory. This is usually too much for $N=C=10^5$ and 256 MB (although it sufficed for "Mowing the Field" due to the 512MB memory limit). Possible ways to get around this:

 - Use arrays of fixed size rather than pointers.
 - Reduce the memory usage of sparse segment tree to $O(N)$ while maintaining the same $O(N\log C)$ insertion time (see the solution for IOI Game below for details).
 - Use [BBSTs](/adv/treaps) instead of sparse segment trees.
