## Introduction

The **Convex Hull** is the subset of points that forms the smallest convex
polygon which encloses all points in the set. To visualize this, imagine that
each point is a pole. Then, imagine what happens if you were to wrap a rope
around the outside of all the poles, and then pull infinitely hard, such that
the connections between any two points that lie on the edge of the rope are
lines. The set of points that touch the rope is the convex hull.

The Graham Scan algorithm works in 3 steps. First, it sorts all of the $n$
points by their counterclockwise angle around a pivot $P_0$, breaking ties by
distance. This algorithm uses the leftmost (and bottommost if there is a tie),
point as $P_0$.

We maintain a stack containing the points such that the following invariant
holds: every three consecutive points $a,b,c$ of the stack form a
counterclockwise turn. In other words, $c$ lies to the left of the line from $a$
to $b$. This condition implies that the points of the stack form the vertices of
a convex polygon.

To start the creation of the convex hull, we choose 2 points. The pivot (first
point), and the second point based on our initial sorting. After that, we
attempt to add each point in $\texttt{cand}$ to the stack.

Denote our stack as $\texttt{hull}$, the top element of $\texttt{hull}$ as
$\texttt{hull}[i]$ and $\texttt{cand}[j]$ as the $j$-th sorted candidate point.
Before adding $\texttt{cand}[j]$ to the stack, we check whether
$\texttt{hull}[i-1] \rightarrow \texttt{hull}[i] \rightarrow \texttt{cand}[j]$
forms a counterclockwise turn.

- If so, then we add $\texttt{cand}[j]$ to the stack and the invariant holds.
  Continue with $\texttt{cand}[j+1]$.
- Otherwise, $\texttt{hull}[i]$ lies within the convex hull of the other points
  in the stack along with $\texttt{cand}[j]$, so we pop $\texttt{hull}[i]$ from
  the stack and continue with $\texttt{cand}[j]$.

Using the steps from our Graham Scan:

1. Sorting the points by counterclockwise angle: Our leftmost point is $(1,2)$,
   so we then sort all the points by their counterclockwise angle. If the angles
   are the same, we can tiebreak by distance. Our resulting sorted points are
   $(2,0),(6,2),(3,2),(5,3),(2,3)$ with initial pivot $(1,2)$. Note that
   $(6,2), (3,2)$, are colinear but since $(6,2)$ is further away it breaks the
   tie, thus placing it before $(3,2)$.

2. Maintaining the stack:

   Our initial stack elements are $(1,2),(2,0)$. Then, starting from
   $\texttt{cand}[2]$, we process each point.

   First, we check if the turn between $(1,2), (2,0)$, and $(3,2)$, is
   counterclockwise, which it is. Hence, the point $\texttt{cand}[2]=(3,2)$ is
   inserted on our stack.

   Our stack now corresponds to the points: $(1,2),(2,0),(3,2)$.

   Then, we check the turn $(2,0),(3,2),(6,2)$, which is clockwise. Hence, we
   pop the stack until the counterclockwise property can be satisfied. In this
   case, only $(3,2)$ is popped. Afterwards, we push $(6, 2)$ to our stack
   because it satisfies the counterclockwise property.

   Our stack now corresponds to the points: $(1,2),(2,0),(6,2)$.

   Then, we check whether the turn between $(2,0), (6,2), (5,3)$ is
   counterclockwise, which it is, so we push $(5,3)$ to our stack.

   Our stack now corresponds to the points: $(1,2),(2,0),(6,2),(5,3)$.

   Then, we check whether the turn between $(6,2),(5,3),(2,3)$ is
   counterclockwise, which it is, so we push $(2,3)$ to our stack.

   Since we have processed all points, we have completed the cycle, and our
   convex hull is complete.

   Our stack now is then $(1,2),(2,0),(6,2),(5,3),(2,3)$, which are the vertices
   of the convex hull.
