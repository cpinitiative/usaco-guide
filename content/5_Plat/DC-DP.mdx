## Example - Circular Barn

<FocusProblem problem="dnc_sample" />

You should already be familiar with the [CHT solution](/plat/convex-hull-trick#problems).

Add analysis later.

## Problems

<Problems problems="dnc_general" />

JOI Bubblesort English Statement: You are given an array of length $N$
$(1 \le N \le 100,000)$. You must choose two numbers in this array and swap
them. After swapping these two numbers, you sort the array using a bubble sort
algorithm. What is the minimum number of bubble sort swaps necessary, assuming
you choose the two initial numbers to swap optimally? The two initial numbers
that you swap do not count towards the minimum number of bubble sort swaps.

<!-- <Info title="Pro Tip">

There are [plenty](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Contests/USACO%20Links/Division-Specific/Platinum.md) of Platinum DP problems that are not covered by this guide. We recommend that you work through these on your own.
