Imagine you have a vertical line that "sweeps" the plane from left to right.
That's the main idea behind the sweep line.

You might be thinking "wait - isn't keeping track of the sweep line at all
possible positions super inefficient?" And you'd be correct. However, we don't
actually need to keep track of the sweep line at all possible positions - only
at the "critical" positions (e.g. points and intersections).

should the reader already be familiar with the 1D case (union of intervals on
number line?) never explicitly mentioned in module

## Radial Sweep

Instead of a vertical line sweeping the plane from left to right, **radial sweep**
involves a ray that rotates around a central point (like a radar screen):

![Radar screen gif](https://i.gifer.com/7jnn.gif)

In this case, we sort points/events by their
[bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(angle)) instead of by their x-
and y-coordinates. Besides that, the mechanics are the same as those of normal
line sweep.

<FocusProblem problem="radialSam" />

### Solution - Seeing the Boundary

**Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N + Rp_i \log R)$

In this problem, there are three types of events: when our ray hits a fence post,
enters a rock, or exits a rock.

The second and third types of events can be found for each rock by sorting the
rays to its vertices by bearing and then taking the two endpoints of the sorted
list. These two rays are the two tangents to the rock.

We can then perform a radial sweep to find the fence posts that Farmer Don can
see - these fence posts are simply the ones where the number of type-2 and type-3
events we've processed so far are equal.

Note that some optimizations (e.g. inserting fence posts in a specific order to
avoid sorting) may be required to get 100 points.
