## Tutorial

Suppose that you want to support the following operations on a tree:

- Update all nodes along the path from node $x$ to node $y$.

- Find the sum, maximum, minimum (or any other operation that satisfies the
  associative property) along the path from node $x$ to node $y$.

Heavy Light Decomposition (or HLD) supports both operations efficiently.

### Definitions

- A **heavy child** of a node is the child with the largest subtree size rooted
  at the child.
- A **light child** of a node is any child that is not a **heavy child**.
- A **heavy edge** connects a node to its **heavy child**.
- A **light edge** connects a node to any of its **light children**.
- A **heavy path** is the path formed by a collection **heavy edges**.
- A **light path** is the path formed by a collection **light edges**.

### Properties

**Any path from node $x$ to node $y$ on the tree can pass through at most
  $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ light edges.**

<Spoiler title="Proof">

Consider a path from node $x$ to node $y$, this path can be broken down into a
path from node $x$ to $LCA(x,y)$ and another path from node $y$ to $LCA(x,y)$.

$LCA(x,y)$ must be an ancestor of both $x$ and $y$ by definition. Hence now we
only need to prove that the path from any node to any of its ancestors can only
pass through $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ light edges to prove the property above.

Suppose that a light edge connects node $x$ and node $y$, where $y$ is a child
of $x$. By the definition of light edge, $y$ must be a light child of $x$. This
means that there has to be another child of $x$ with a larger subtree size than
$y$, or else $y$ will become the heavy child of $x$. Hence the size of the
subtree rooted at $x$ must be at least two times of the size of the subtree
rooted at $y$. 

Since the subtree size of a node can not exceed the total number
of nodes $N$, the doubling process can only happen at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$
times when traversing up from an arbitrary node to its parent along a light
edge. Given this, we now know that there could be at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$
light edges in both the path from $x$ to $LCA(x,y)$ and the path from $LCA(x,y)$
to $y$. Hence there are at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N + \log N)$ =
$\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ light edges in the path from an arbitrary node $x$ to an
arbitrary node $y$.

</Spoiler>

Since a heavy path can only be broken by a light edge (or else the edge will be a part of the heavy
path), we can know that there are at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ heavy paths on
any path from an arbitrary node $x$ to an arbitrary node $y$.

In addition, by using segment trees (or any other RURQ data structure) we can
calculate the value of any consecutive interval on any heavy path in
$\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time.

Since there are at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ heavy paths and
$\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ light edges, computing the value on the path from node $x$
to node $y$ will take $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 N + \log N)$ = $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 N)$
time. We can answer $Q$ queries in $\mathcal{O}(Q \log^2 N)$ time.

We can solve the focus problem "Path Queries II" using Heavy Light
Decomposition:
