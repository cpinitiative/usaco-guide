# Third Party Services

The following is a list of third party services that the USACO Guide /
Competitive Programming Initiative uses.

## USACO Guide

- Hosted on Vercel (sponsored hosting, but the free hobby tier will likely
  suffice)
  - Can also host on Netlify
  - Can also host by yourself
- Firebase backend (pay-as-you-go plan, pretty generous free tier)
  - No easy replacement
  - Technically can function without Firebase -- user login wouldn't work,
    classes wouldn't work, but everything else will still work (including local
    progress tracking)
- Algolia for Search
  - Open source plan. With some optimizations you _might_ be able to get by with
    the free tier plan. Otherwise pay as you go.
  - No easy replacement. Without this, module search + problems search won't
    work.
- Hotjar & Google analytics

## IDE

- https://github.com/thecodingwizard/ide
- Uses a [Judge0](https://github.com/judge0/judge0) instance hosted on
  DigitalOcean at https://judge0.usaco.guide/

## Forum

- Hosted on DigitalOcean (\$20/mo)
  - Can host on any VPS
  - Hub for Good sponsorship -- \$250 in credits (yearly? may need to reapply)
- Uses Discourse (open source, free)
  - One-click setup on DigitalOcean doesn't work -- manually configure app.yml
- Uses Mailgun as email provider (currently on pay-as-you-go plan, may or may
  not cost some \$\$ depending on scale)

## Domain Names

- https://joincpi.org/ -- Registered under Google Domains, \$12/yr
