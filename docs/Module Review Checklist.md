      written
- [ ] No typos, explanations are clear, no missing sections
- [ ] Table of Contents looks good
- [ ] Resources are good
  - [ ] Resources are starred appropriately (star == must read)
  - [ ] All resources are useful (get rid of ones that aren't needed)
  - [ ] All resources should have descriptions
- [ ] Explanations do not unnecessarily repeat what resources already cover.
- [ ] Problems are good
  - [ ] There are sufficient problems
  - [ ] Problems are tagged with difficulty and tags as needed
  - [ ] Problems either are linked to a good enough external solution, or a
        solution is written for them
  - [ ] There are _no solution sketches_ -- migrate solution sketches into full
        editorial pages.
