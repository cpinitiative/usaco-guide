# Content Documentation

Note: You may find [this live editor](https://usaco.guide/liveupdate) helpful when writing modules.

The following two modules are good to read:

1. https://usaco.guide/general/modules
2. https://usaco.guide/general/code-con

All modules are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). There are special additions to the markdown that we have added to this site. If you are confused about something, or if there's a certain feature that you want to add, reach out to Nathan Wang.

## 1. Getting Started

### Running Site Locally

It is highly recommended to [run a local version of the site](Front%20End%20Documentation.md) in order to view your changes.

### Using Sublime Text with .mdx

1. Download [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
2. Open the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P) and install package control.
3. Open the command palette again, install package -> PackageResourceViewer
4. Extract the HTML package with PackageResourceViewer.
5. Now you can modify `html_completions.py` by adding to `normal_tags` (ex. `spoiler`)
   - actually, for some reason uppercase (`CPPSection`) doesn't work ...
6. Open a `.mdx` file and set syntax highlighting to be the same as `.md` with `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as ... -> Markdown -> Markdown`.
7. Make snippets!

### Other Tools

- You can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) to check that latex renders properly.
- [Markdown Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

## 2. Module Ordering

### Organization

There are six **sections** in the guide: Intro, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Advanced. Each section is subdivided into **categories**, which is just a group of modules. Each **module** represents one "article" or "page" on the site.

### `ordering.ts`

Located at `content/ordering.ts`, this file stores the ordering of the modules. Hopefully the format is self-explanatory (it matches based on "slug"). Let Nathan Wang know if you have questions.

## 3. Frontmatter

[Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is the stuff in the beginning of each module that's surrounded by three dashes. Frontmatter is written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/). It stores the "metadata" for each module.

- **ID**: _Required_. The ID of the module. Ex: `getting-started`, or `containers`. This ID is used to identify the module, so make sure it is **unique** and **all lowercase with dashes only**. The URL will be generated based off this.
- **Title**: _Required_. The title of the module. Ex: `Getting Started`
- **Author**: _Required_. The author of the module. Ex: `Unknown`
- **Description**: _Required_. A short description of the module, similar to what [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) has in their syllabus. Markdown/Latex does not work in the description field.
- **Prerequisites**: _Optional_. Any prerequisites for this module. If you want to reference a module as a prerequisite, list it as a module ID. A link will be auto-generated.
- **Frequency**: _Optional_. Takes a number 0-4 inclusive, where 0 = never shown up before and 4 = shows up ~once a contest. Leave this field out if you don't want to show the frequency.

### Example Frontmatter

```

id: getting-started

# Getting Started

```

### Linking to Modules

Do `[insert text here](/general/code-con)`.

Don't use relative links like `code-con`, that will break our link checker...

### Link Checker

`yarn build && yarn serve` -- keep this terminal alive!

`yarn check-links`

If crash due to some `bhttp` error, it's probably a timeout. To fix temporarily, run:

```
blc http://localhost:9000 -rof --exclude train.usaco.org
```

And find where it crashes, then check the broken link manually and add to exclusion list. As train.usaco.org sometimes crashes, it's added already.

## 4. Table of Contents

A table of contents will be auto-generated based off of the headings in the Markdown. Keep this in mind when formatting your module.

## 5. MDX and Custom Components

We're using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a superset of Markdown. HTML and React components are supported, so it is possible to add interactivity / custom components to each module.

Some components are globally available in every module (without having to be imported):

- `<Spoiler>`
- `<Info>`
- `<Warning>`
- `<Optional>`
- `<Problems>`
- `<FocusProblem>`
- `<Resources>`
- `<Resource>`
- `<TextTooltip>`
- `<LanguageSection>`
- `<CPPSection>`
- `<JavaSection>`
- `<PySection>`
- `<IncompleteSection>`
- `<Asterisk>`

These are all documented below.

### Using Custom Components

Interleaving Markdown in JSX is currently a work-in-progress: https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/628. As such, in order to use markdown with custom components, we need to leave **blank lines** between the HTML tags and the markdown.

```mdx
Good:

<Spoiler>

This is **bold**.

</Spoiler>
```

```mdx
Bad:

<Spoiler>This is NOT **bold**.</Spoiler>

<Spoiler>This isn't **bold** either!</Spoiler>
```

### Spoilers

Spoilers are collapsible elements that only show themselves when the user clicks on it. It's useful when writing solutions to problems.

```
<Spoiler title="Show Solution">

- Insert OP benq solution here

</Spoiler>
```

### Info Block

```
<Info title="Insert Title Here">

**Markdown is Supported!!**

</Info>
```

### Warning Block

```
<Warning title="Insert Title Here">

Fun fact: the title attribute is optional.

</Warning>
```

### Optional Content

```
<Optional title="Insert Title Here">

Fun fact: the title attribute is optional.

</Optional>
```

### Problem Lists

**Problem sketches are deprecated. Do not add any new problem sketches.**

Problem constructor syntax:

```
new Problem("Source", "Problem Name", "Problem ID (this is used to generate link to problem)", "Difficulty", starred, ["tags"], "editorial-id", "editorial quality")
```

To add problem editorials, create a new file under the `solutions/` folder. Try to name it something reasonable; follow existing naming conventions.

Editorials are also written in MDX. The frontmatter has three fields:

```
---
id: cses-1621
title: CSES Distinct Numbers
author: Nathan Wang
---

... solution
```

The author field is optional.

To reference that editorial:

```
new Problem("CSES", "Distinct Numbers", "1621", "Easy", false, ["sets"], "cses-1621", "good")
```

The important parameters are the last two: `cses-1621` is equal to the frontmatter ID, and `good` shows a green check next to the problem to indicate that the editorial is of high quality.

Problem constructor:

```typescript
class Problem {
	constructor(
		public source: string,
		public name: string,
		public id: string,
		labels?: 'Very Easy' | 'Easy' | 'Normal' | 'Hard' | 'Very Hard' | 'Insane',
		public starred?: boolean,
		public tags?: string[],
		sol?: string, // either a URL, an empty string (USACO auto-populates), or a problem editorial ID
		public solQuality: 'bad' | 'ok' | 'good' = 'ok'
	) {}
}
```

Example usage:

```mdx
---
id: ds
title: Data Structures
author: Nathan Wang, Darren Yao, Benjamin Qi
description: Introductory problems using sets and maps.
prerequisites:
  - Bronze - "Built-In C++ Containers" or "Built-In Java Collections"
---

import { Problem } from '../models';

export const problems = {
	standard: [
		new Problem('YS', 'Associative Array', 'associative_array', 'Intro'),
		new Problem('CSES', 'Distinct Numbers', '1621', 'Intro'),
		new Problem(
			'CSES',
			'Sum of Two Values',
			'1640',
			'Intro',
			false,
			[],
			'Can be solved without sets.'
		),
		new Problem('CSES', 'Concert Tickets', '1091', 'Easy', false, [
			'iterators',
		]),
		new Problem('CSES', 'Towers', '1073', 'Easy', false, [
			'multiset',
			'greedy',
		]),
		new Problem('CSES', 'Traffic Lights', '1163', 'Normal', false, ['set']),
		new Problem('CSES', 'Room Allocation', '1164', 'Normal', false, [
			'multiset',
			'greedy',
		]),
	],
};

## Standard

Do roughly the first half of the Sorting and Searching section in the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

<Problems problems={problems.standard} />
```

### Focus Problem

Displays a singular problem as a "focus problem."

```
<FocusProblem problem={problems.genPermutations[0]} />
```

Make sure to still use an array: `gatsby-node.ts` expects all exported problems to be in arrays...

### Resource Lists

```
<Resources>
  <Resource
    source="Errichto"
    title="Video - How to test your solution"
    url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM"
    starred
  >
    using a script to stress test
  </Resource>
  ...
</Resources>
```

    };
    ```

### Tooltips

There are two main types of tooltips: text tooltips, which display a dotted underline under the text, and asterisk tooltips, which render an asterisk that can be hovered over.

#### `<TextTooltip>`

```jsx
<TextTooltip content="Popup text goes here">short text goes here</TextTooltip>
```

#### `<Asterisk>`

```jsx
<Asterisk>Popup text goes here</Asterisk>
```

### Language-Specific Content

```mdx
<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

# A heading that only appears in C++

CPP content goes here, note the newlines!

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

Java content goes here!

</JavaSection>
<PySection />
</LanguageSection>
```

In the example above, nothing will be rendered for Python.

### Incomplete Section

```mdx
<IncompleteSection>

- this list is optional and can be used to specify what is missing
- missing 32-bit integer explanation

</IncompleteSection>
```
