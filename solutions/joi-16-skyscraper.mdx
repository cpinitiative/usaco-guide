**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal O(N^2L)$.

We will use [connected component DP](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/47764) to
solve this problem.

First, sort the buildings by height. We will now "insert" them into the final
permutation at various positions and count the number of ways to do so.

Let $dp[i][j][k][m]$ denote the number of ways to insert the first $i$ buildings
into the permutation such that:

- There were $j$ "connected components" (i.e. subarrays with all positions
  filled).
- The "total cost" (assuming that all empty positions contain $a_{i + 1}$, where
  $a_{n + 1} = \infty$) is $k$.
- $m$ of the endpoints of the permutation have been filled so far.

For example, $\{?, ?, 3, ?, 2, 1\}$ (a half-filled permutation of
$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$) would be counted in $dp[3][2][5][1]$.

Note that we don't cwere about the relative orders of the connected components
for each DP state. (Imagine that they're just free-floating components that we
can pluck out of space and join.)

When we transition from $dp[i - 1]$ to $dp[i]$, all the empty positions will
change from $a_i$ to $a_{i + 1}$, so the change in total cost (given $j$ and
$m$) would thus be $\Delta_{j, m} = (2j - m)(a_{i + 1} - a_i)$. Each connected
component contributes $2(a_{i + 1} - a_i)$ to $\Delta_{j, m}$ except for those
containing endpoints, which only contribute $a_{i + 1} - a_i$.

We now have five cases to consider when calculating $dp[i][j][k][m]$:

- We **inserted** $a_i$ to form a new component that doesn't contain an endpoint
  of the permutation.
  - There were $dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m]$ ways to do this.
- We **inserted** $a_i$ to form a new component that contains an endpoint of the
  permutation.
  - This is only possible if $m > 0$.
  - If so, there were $(3 - m) \cdot dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m - 1]$
    ways to do this.
- We **appended** $a_i$ to an existing component such that it doesn't contain an
  end of the permutation.
  - There were $2j - m$ component endpoints to choose from, so there were
    $(2j - m) \cdot dp[i - 1][j][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m]$ ways to do this.
- We **appended** $a_i$ to an existing component such that it contains of the
  permutation.
  - This is only possible if $m > 0$.
  - If $m = 1$, then there were $2j$ component endpoints to choose from, so
    there were $2j \cdot dp[i - 1][j][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m - 1]$ ways to do
    this.
  - If $m = 2$, and $j = 1$, then $i = n$ must hold and so there were
    $dp[i - 1][j][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m - 1]$ ways to do this.
  - Otherwise, there were $j - 1$ component endpoints to choose from (we can't
    choose the other component containing an endpoint of the permutation!), so
    there were $(j - 1) \cdot dp[i - 1][j][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m - 1]$ ways to do
    this.
- We inserted $a_i$ to **join** two existing components.
  - If $m = 2$ and $i = n$, then there can only be two components left, so there
    were $dp[i - 1][j + 1][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m]$ ways to do this.
  - If $m = 2$ otherwise, then there were $j(j - 1)$ ordered pairs of components
    to choose from, so there were
    $j(j - 1) \cdot dp[i - 1][j + 1][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m]$ ways to do this.
  - If $m = 1$, then there were $j^2$ ordered pairs of components to choose
    from, so there were $j^2 \cdot dp[i - 1][j + 1][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m]$ ways
    to do this.
  - Otherwise, there were $j(j + 1)$ ordered pairs of components to choose from,
    so there were $j(j + 1) \cdot dp[i - 1][j + 1][k - \Delta_{j, m}][m]$ ways
    to do this.
