Although the intended solution is extremely difficult, this is not too hard to
fakesolve! First write some $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ DP that is somehow fast enough to
pass test cases 1-6.

This won't work for test cases 7-11, but these test cases are quite special!

<Spoiler title="How So?">

In these test cases the trees have at most 20 leaves. Therefore it suffices to
compress tree edges (repeatedly remove vertices of degree 2) and run the same
solution.
