## Explanation

Notice that groups of intersections can **form strongly connected components.**
Therefore, treat each component as a node with initial value equal to the size
of the component. Since the resulting strongly connected components
$\texttt{comp}$ form a directed acyclic graph (specifically a tree, because of
the "justness" from the problem statement), process the edges $e$ in reverse
topographical order $c$ with the following relation where $\texttt{dp}[i]$ is
the # of intersections that can be reached from component $i$:

$$
\texttt{dp}[\texttt{comp}[e]] = \texttt{dp}[\texttt{comp}[e]] +\sum_{e \in \texttt{radj}[c]} \texttt{dp}[\texttt{{comp}}[c]] : \texttt{comp}[c] \neq \texttt{comp}[e]
$$

The final answer for intersection $i$ is $\texttt{dp}[\texttt{comp}[i]] - 1$,
since we exclude the starting intersection from the answer.

<Warning>

This solution _only_ works on a tree (and not a general DAG), because of over
counting.

Suppose we have a graph with $N=4$ nodes, and the edges

```
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 4
```

which correspond to the edges
$1 \rightarrow 2, 1 \rightarrow 3,2 \rightarrow 4,3 \rightarrow 4$.

A valid topographical sort could be in the order $4, 2, 3, 1$, which would not
work because node $4$ is counted twice. Our calls would be as follows:

- $\texttt{dp}[4] = 1$
- $\texttt{dp}[2] = 1 + \texttt{dp}[4] = 2$
- $\texttt{dp}[3] = 1 + \texttt{dp}[4] = 2$
- $\texttt{dp}[1] = 1 + \texttt{dp}[2] + \texttt{dp}[3] = 5$

Evidently, $\texttt{dp}[4]$ is counted twice in $\texttt{dp}[1]$.

</Warning>

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N + M)$
