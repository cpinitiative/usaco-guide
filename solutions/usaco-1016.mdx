[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_clocktree_silver_feb20.html)

We can build a graph with the rooms as nodes and corridors as edges. Consider a simple case: there are 2 nodes in the graph and one edge.
Bessie can start from one of the rooms, go to its neighbor, increase the clock, go back, and increase the starting room's clock.
During this process of moving back and forth, notice that the difference between two rooms' clock readings may only change by 1.
If the starting clock readings differ by one, Bessie can start from the bigger clock reading room and travel back and forth until both of the clocks point to 12.
If the starting clock readings differ by more than one, it is impossible for Bessie to make both clocks point to 12.

If there are more nodes, we can treat it similar to the two node case by considering the two groups in a bipartite partition. As all trees are bipartite graphs, this partition always exists.

The first time Bessie visits a neighbor node, the sum of clocks of the first group increases by 1.
Then Bessie visits another neighbor node, the sum of clocks of the second group increases by 1.
As both sums increase by one, the difference between the sums does not change.
This process repeats until all clocks reach 12.

We can check the initial sum difference between the two groups (mod 12) to figure out the final clock numbers, where we define $\texttt{group0}$ and $\texttt{group1}$ as the sums of the clocks in each of the two groups of the bipartite partition.

1. If $\texttt{group0}$ is the same as $\texttt{group1}$ (mod 12), Bessie can start from any node.
2. If $\texttt{group0}$ is 1 smaller than $\texttt{group1}$ (mod 12), Bessie can start from any node in $\texttt{group1}$.
3. If $\texttt{group1}$ is 1 smaller than $\texttt{group0}$ (mod 12), Bessie can start from any node in $\texttt{group0}$.
4. If $\texttt{group0}$ and $\texttt{group1}$ differ by at least 2 (mod 12), there's no way to get all clocks to point to 12.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int N;
vector<int> edges[100000];
int A[100000];
int sum0, sum1, nodes0, nodes1;

void dfs(int i, int color, int par) {
	// update color/sum
	if (color == 0) {
		nodes0++;
		sum0 += A[i];
	}
	else {
		nodes1++;
		sum1 += A[i];
	}
	
	for (int j : edges[i]) {				   
		if (j != par) {
			// swap colors for the child
			dfs(j, 1 - color, i);
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	freopen("clocktree.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("clocktree.out", "w", stdout);

	cin >> N;

	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		cin >> A[i];
	}

	for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {	
		int a, b;
		cin >> a >> b;
		a--, b--;
		edges[a].push_back(b);
		edges[b].push_back(a);
	}
	
	dfs(0, 0, -1);

	// same mod means you can start anywhere
	if ((sum0 % 12) == (sum1 % 12)) {
		cout << N;
	}
	// if group0 is 1 smaller than group1, we must start from group1
	else if ((sum0 + 1) % 12 == (sum1 % 12)) {
		cout << nodes1;
	}
	// if group1 is 1 smaller than group0, we must start from group0
	else if ((sum0 % 12) == ((sum1 + 1) % 12)) {
		cout << nodes0;
	}
	// no way to get all clocks pointing to 12
	else {
		cout << 0;
	}

}
