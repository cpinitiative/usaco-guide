## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

<LanguageSection>

<PySection>

```python
n = int(input())
cows = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
stalls = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))

cows.sort()
stalls.sort()

possible_places = [0] * n

# Create a list containing the number of stalls each cow can use.
for i in range(n):
	for j in range(n):
		if cows[i] <= stalls[j]:
			possible_places[i] += 1

# Initialize a cumulative product
product = 1

# For each cow, find out the number of stalls it can use in a valid permutation
# Use the formula provided in the explanation
# Multiply the cumulative product by this value
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
	product *= (possible_places[i] - (n - i - 1))

print(product)
```
