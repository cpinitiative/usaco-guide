{/* In this problem, we're asked the maximum number of movie intervals $(start, end)$ we can cover using $k$ people. */}

{/* ## Main Idea */}

The first step is the same as that of
[Movie Festival](/silver/greedy-sorting#example---the-scheduling-problem); sort
the movies in increasing order of end time. For each movie in order, we will
assign it to one of the $K$ members to watch (or none of them).

Keep track of the time each member finishes watching all of his currently
assigned movies in a sorted collection (e.g. a
[`multiset`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/multiset) in C++).
Initially, the collection consists of $K$ zeroes.

For each movie in order, we can assign a member to watch it if there exists an
element in the sorted collection less than or equal to the start time of the
movie. If there are multiple such elements, choose the greatest one (the member
who finished watching his assigned movies the latest). Assign the member to
watch this movie by incrementing the answer and updating the collection
accordingly.

{/* If there are multiple members, choose the one who finishes watching the previous movie latest (that way, if we encounter a movie that has an earlier start time, we can still assign that movie). */}

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
	vector<pair<int, int>> v(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) // read start time, end time
		cin >> v[i].second >> v[i].first;
	sort(begin(v), end(v)); // sort by end time

	int ans = 0;
	multiset<int> end_times; // times when members will finish watching movies
	for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
		end_times.insert(0);

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		auto it = end_times.upper_bound(v[i].second);
		if (it == begin(end_times)) continue;
		// assign movie to be watched by member in multiset who finishes at time *prev(it)
		end_times.erase(--it);
		// member now finishes watching at time v[i].first
		end_times.insert(v[i].first);
		++ ans;
	}

	cout << ans;
}
```
