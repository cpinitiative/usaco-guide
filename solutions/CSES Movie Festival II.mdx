This problem is significantly easier after solving Movie Festival.

</Warning>

In this problem, we're asked the maximum number of movie intervals $(start, end)$ we can cover using $k$ people rather than $1$.

# Main Idea

First, solve the one person variant of this problem. We can use the same apporach and include multiple people instead of just one.

Whenever we come across a movie, we check if someone who previously watched a movie can watch this one too. If there are multiple people that can have this movie assigned, choose the latest one (that way if we encounter a movie that has an earlier start time, we can still assign that movie).

If the above condition doesn't hold and there are currently less than K people watching a movie, we can just assign a new person to this movie.

We can keep a hold of the people watching movies by storing it in some sort of collection, a multiset is used below.

Implementation using a multiset in C++:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int n, k;
vector<pair<int, int> > v(200005);

int main() {
	cin >> n >> k;
	v.resize(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		// this will allow us to sort by end time.
		cin >> v[i].second >> v[i].first;
	}
	sort(v.begin(), v.end());


	int ans = 0;
	multiset<int> st;

	// v[i].s is really the start time of movie i, and v[i].f is the end time.
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

		bool flag = 0;
		// try assigning this movie to someone already in the multiset.
		if (!st.empty()) {
			auto it = st.upper_bound(v[i].second);
			if (it != st.begin()) {
				--it;
				if (*it <= v[i].second) {
					st.erase(it);
					st.insert(v[i].first);
					flag = 1, ans++;
				}
			}
		}

		if (st.size() < k && flag == false) {
			st.insert(v[i].first);
			ans++;
		}
	}


	cout << ans;
}

```
