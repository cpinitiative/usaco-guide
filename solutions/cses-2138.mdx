title: Reachable Nodes

## Explanation

The naive approach would be to create a $N$ by $N$ 2D array that tracks whether
node $v$ can be reached from node $u$. However, that would clearly take up too
much memory ($2.5 \cdot 10^9$ bytes or $2500$ MB). We can optimize this using
bitsets. Using a 2D array of bitsets, the revised complexity becomes
$\frac{2.5 \cdot 10^9}{32} \cdot 4 = 3.25 \cdot 10^8$ bytes or $312.5$ MB, which is much
more efficient.

To do the actual calculation we can just do a DFS and for every node a child can
reach, we mark it down for the parent as well.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N + M)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 5e4;

vector<int> graph[MAXN + 1];
bitset<MAXN + 1> can[MAXN + 1];
vector<bool> visited(MAXN + 1);

void dfs(int node) {
	visited[node] = true;

	// base case: node can reach itself
	can[node][node] = 1;

	for (int i : graph[node]) {
		if (!visited[i]) {
			dfs(i);
		}

		// activate all bits that are also in its child
		can[node] |= can[i];
	}
}

int main() {
	cin.tie(0) -> sync_with_stdio(0);
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;

	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int u, v;
		cin >> u >> v;
		graph[u].push_back(v);
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (!visited[i]) {
			dfs(i);
		}
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		// output the number of activated bits
		cout << can[i].count() << " ";
	}
}
```
