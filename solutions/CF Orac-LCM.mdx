## Solution

For each prime, the second-to-lowest exponent of the prime that occurs in any of the numbers in the input is the exponent of this prime that will appear in the final answer. 

Here's a short solution that accomplishes this without explicitly computing any prime factorizations!

```cpp
ll a,b; 
// a stores minimum exponents
// b stores second minimum exponents
int n;

void red() { // restore invariant mentioned above
	ll g = __gcd(a,b);
	tie(a,b) = mp(g,a/g*b);
}

int main() {
	re(n,a,b); red();
	FOR(i,2,n) {
		ll x; re(x); 
		b = __gcd(b,x);
		red();
	}
	ps(b);
}
```

If it's hard to understand what exactly this code is doing at first glance, a good first step is to simulating the code in the case where each $a_i$ is a power of the same prime (say, $2^k$). If the algorithm works for this case, then it will also work in the general case since the contributions of different primes are computed independently and multiplied together.
