[Official Analysis](http://usaco.org/current/data/sol_bphoto_gold_jan17.html)

The official solution uses a
[binary indexed tree](/gold/PURS/#binary-indexed-tree).

An alternative solution uses an order statistic tree. This is provided in C++
with the PBDS data structure; in Java you'll have to implement your own.

## Solution (C++ only)

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N \log N)$

We aim to quickly determine, for each cow, the number of _taller_ cows to its
left and right.

To do this, we can sweep through the cows from left to right and maintain two
balanced binary search trees: one for storing the heights of cows on each side
of the current cow. Then, use binary search to count the number of heights in
each set that are greater than the height of the current cow.

We can use [order statistic trees](/gold/PURS/#order-statistic-tree) to achieve
this in $\mathcal O(N \log N)$ time.

<Warning>

We may **not** use [`std::set`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/)
because it does not support indexing. Additionally, since BBSTs do _not_ support
random access, using operations such as
[`std::distance`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/distance/) to
index takes linear time.
