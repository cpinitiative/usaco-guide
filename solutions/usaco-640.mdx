[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_bcs_bronze_open16.html)

We can loop through all possible pairs of pieces and shift them to check if they
can make the original figurine. Since we cannot shift a piece so any '#' fall
outside the $N \times N$ grid, we need to find the sides of the pieces to
determine how far to shift them.

<Warning>

The official solution doesn't check if any '#' fall outside the $N \times N$
grid.

</Warning>

As we iterate the pieces, we find the left, right, top and bottom sides of the
piece and store them in the $s$ array. When we are shifting, we shift
$\texttt{piece[i]}$ $\texttt{idy}$ units to the left and $\texttt{idx}$ units
up, and shift $\texttt{piece[j]}$ $\texttt{jdy}$ units to the left and
$\texttt{jdx}$ units up. This will send the piece at
$(x + \texttt{idx}, y + \texttt{idy})$ to $(x, y)$ and the piece at
$(x + \texttt{jdx}, y + \texttt{jdy})$ to $(x, y)$. So, we see that
$\texttt{idy}$ must be bounded by $\texttt{right} - n + 1$ and $\texttt{left}$,
and $\texttt{idx}$ must be bounded by $\texttt{bottom} - n + 1$ and
$\texttt{top}$, with $\texttt{jdy}$ and $\texttt{jdx}$ bounded similarly.
Because of that, every '#' will fall inside the $N \times N$ grid.

Once we have shifted the pieces, if there are two '#' in the same place, or if
the result of superimposing the pieces is not the same as the original figurine
($\texttt{pieces[0]}$), then this shift will not work.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(K^2 \cdot N^6)$

```cpp
#include <iostream>

	freopen("bcs.out", "w", stdout);
	int k;
	cin >> n >> k;
	char c;
	int left, right, top, bottom;
	for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++)
	{
		left = n - 1;

			}
		}
		s[i] = {left, right, top, bottom};
	}

	//try all the pieces and shifts to find the correct one
	for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++)
	{
		for (int j = i + 1; j <= k; j++)
		{

				{
					for (int jdx = s[j][3] - n + 1; jdx <= s[j][2]; jdx++)
					{

						{
							bool good = true;

									bool ipiece = check(i, x + idx, y + idy);
									bool jpiece = check(j, x + jdx, y + jdy);
									//two '#' are in the same place
									if (ipiece && jpiece)
									{

										break;

									//the result doesn't match the figurine
									if (pieces[0][x][y] != (ipiece || jpiece))
									{

										break;
									}
								}
								if (!good)
								{
									break;
								}
							}
							if (good)
							{
								cout << i << " " << j << endl;
								return 0;
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

//check if a piece is in bounds and is '#'
bool check(int piece, int x, int y)
{
	return x >= 0 && x < n && y >= 0 && y < n && pieces[piece][x][y];
}
