[Official Editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/83553)

I assume that you've

- heard of
  [linear programming duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_linear_program)
- read the parts of the editorial mentioning min-cost flow

This explanation is meant to clarify how the min-cost flow graph is derived.

Essentially, we want to find the best possible lower bound on the answer, which
turns out to be equal to the answer by duality.

As the editorial mentions, you want to minimize $\sum c_{u,v}$ subject to some
inequalities of the form

$$
\text{Eq}(u,v)=\left[c_{u,v}\ge x_u-x_v\right].
$$

Each $c_{u,v}\ge 0$, and some $x_u$ are fixed (for tiles on the boundary) while
the others are unbounded (if we ignore the constraint that each
$x_i\in [1,10^9]$). Essentially, to find we want a linear combination of these
equations

$$
\text{Eq}=\sum a_{u,v}\text{Eq}(u,v)
$$

such that the following conditions are satisfied.

- Each $a_{u,v}$ corresponds to the flow on an edge of the min-cost flow graph,
  so these must be non-negative.
- On the LHS of $\text{Eq}$, no $c_{u,v}$ has coefficient greater than one. This
  corresponds to $a_{u,v}+a_{v,u}\le 1$, meaning that the flow on each edge of
  the min-cost flow graph is at most $1$.
- The coefficients of each non-constant $x_u$ on the RHS of $\text{Eq}$ are
  zero. This means that in the min-cost flow graph, each vertex (aside from the
  source and the sink) has the same in-flow as out-flow.
- The constant on the right side is maximized (we want the best possible lower
  bound).

**Example:** (should hopefully clarify the above)

Suppose that

$$
c_{4,5}\ge x_4-x_5
$$

$$
c_{2,5}\ge x_2-x_5
$$

$$
c_{5,1}\ge x_5-x_1
$$

$$
c_{5,3}\ge x_5-x_3
$$

and that $x_i=i$ for each $1\le i\le 4$ while $x_5$ is unbounded. What is the
minimum possible value of

$$
\sum c_{u,v}=c_{4,5}+c_{2,5}+c_{5,1}+c_{5,3}?
$$

**Solution:** In this case, the answer is $4-1=3$. We can show that this is a
lower bound by choosing

$$
a_{4,5}=1, a_{2,5}=0, a_{5,1}=1, a_{5,3}=0.
$$

Then we get the linear combination

$$
\text{Eq}=a_{4,5}\cdot \left[c_{4,5}\ge x_4-x_5\right]+a_{5,1}\cdot \left[c_{5,1}\ge x_5-x_1\right]
$$

$$
1\cdot \left[c_{4,5}\ge x_4-x_5\right]+1\cdot \left[c_{5,1}\ge x_5-x_1\right]
$$

$$
\text{Eq}=[c_{4,5}+c_{5,1}\ge x_4-x_1].
$$

It follows that

$$
\sum c_{u,v}\ge c_{4,5}+c_{5,1}\ge x_4-x_1=4-1=3.
$$

This corresponds to a min cost flow graph with $5$ vertices plus a source and a
sink where all edges have capacity $1$.

- Draw edges from $4$ to $5$, $2$ to $5$, $5$ to $1$, and $5$ to $3$ with cost
  $0$.
- Drawing edges from the source to vertex $4$ with cost $4$ and from the source
  to vertex $2$ with cost $2$.
- Drawing edges from vertex $3$ to the sink with cost $-3$ and from vertex $1$
  to the sink with cost $-1$.
- Finding the maximum cost flow from the source to the sink. In this case, we
  just send one unit of flow from

$$
\text{source}\to 4\to 5\to 1\to \text{sink}.
$$

In the original problem the edges go both ways (not just one way), but the idea
is similar.
