## Solution

[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_family_bronze_open18.html)

By finding the closest common ancestor and the distances from the ancestor to the two cows, we can uniquely identify their relationship.
## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$

## Alternative Solution - BFS

Note: This is an **alternative** solution and makes use of concepts outside the
scope of Bronze. Breadth-first search is **not necessary** to know for the
bronze division.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

This problem can also be solved by using BFS to find the common ancestors and
the distance between the two cows and their nearest common ancestor.

<Warning>

No Bronze / Silver problem has required knowledge of BFS, so feel free to skip
this solution if you find it unfamiliar and come back later.
