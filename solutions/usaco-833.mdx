## Solution

[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_family_bronze_open18.html)

By finding the closest common ancestor and the distances from the ancestor to the two cows, we can uniquely identify their relationship.
## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open('family.in', 'r')
sys.stdout = open('family.out', 'w')

n, a, b = input().split()
relations = []

for i in range(int(n)):     
	relations.append(input().split())

# gets the mother of the cow (if it exists)
def mother(cow):
	for i in relations:
		if i[1] == cow:
			return i[0]
	return None

# finds if cow is a direct ancestor of cow2 by repeatedly 
# getting the mother of cow2.
def direct_anc(cow, cow2):
	counter = 0
	while cow2 != None:
		if cow == cow2:
			return counter
		cow2 = mother(cow2)
		counter += 1
	return -1

# distance from a to the common ancestor
da = 0
cow = a

while cow != None:
	# if we found a common ancestor
	if direct_anc(cow, b) != -1:
		break
	cow = mother(cow)
	da += 1

# if a common ancestor does not exist
if cow == None:
	print('NOT RELATED')
	sys.exit()

"""
since we found a common ancestor, cow.
we can call direct_anc() to get the distance
from b to the common ancestor.
"""
db = direct_anc(cow, b)
	
"""
if they're related by a common ancestor, 
but not by a mother or aunt, we can return
COUSINS.
"""
if da > 1 and db > 1:
	print('COUSINS')
	sys.exit()

# if the distance from each cow to their common 
# ancestor is one, they're siblings,
elif da == 1 and db == 1:
	print('SIBLINGS')
	sys.exit()
else:
	if da > db:
		da, db = db, da
		b, a = a, b
	print(a, 'is the ', end='')

	# we subtract two because 1 is in place of mother
	# and 2 is in place of grandmother
	for _ in range(db - 2):
		print("great-", end='')
	if da == 0 and db > 1:
		print('grand-', end='')
	if da == 0:
		print('mother ', end='')
	else:
		print('aunt ', end='')
	print('of', b)

## Alternative Solution - BFS

Note: This is an **alternative** solution and makes use of concepts outside the
scope of Bronze. Breadth-first search is **not necessary** to know for the
bronze division.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

This problem can also be solved by using BFS to find the common ancestors and
the distance between the two cows and their nearest common ancestor.

<Warning>

No Bronze / Silver problem has required knowledge of BFS, so feel free to skip
this solution if you find it unfamiliar and come back later.
