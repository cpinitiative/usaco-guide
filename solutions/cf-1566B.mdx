# Explanation

Since the MEX can be at most 2 when there is a substring that contains a 0 and 1, there's only 3 possible cases. If there are no zeros, then the MEX is 0, since all substrings would be missing a 0.  If all zeros are adjacent to one another, we can cut the entire sequence out, leaving a MEX of 1. The other groups, all comprised of ones would have a MEX of 0. Leaving the answer to be $max(0, 1) = 1$. Lastly, if there are zeros and they're not adjacent to one another, then a substring like ${0, 1}$ must exist, resulting in a MEX of 2.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
		string s;
		cin >> s;
		// find the number of zeros
		int zeros = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0');

		// no zeros, the answer is 0
		if (zeros == 0) {
			cout << 0 << endl;
		} else {
			// first and last occurences of zero
			int l = s.find('0');
			int r = s.rfind('0');
			
			// if they're all adjacent to one another.
			cout << ((r - l + 1 == zeros) ? 1 : 2) << endl;
		}
	}
}
```
</CPPSection>

<PySection>

```py
for _ in range(int(input())):
	s = input()
	zeros = s.count("0")

	if zeros == 0:
		print(0)
	else:
		l = s.find("0")
		r = s.rfind("0")
  
		print(1 if r - l + 1 == zeros else 2)
```
