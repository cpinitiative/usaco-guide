## Implementation 1 - Brute Force

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot T)$, where $T$ is the maximum time in the input.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

const int MAX_TIME = 1000;

struct Cow {
	int start, end;
	int buckets;
};

int main() {
	std::ifstream read("blist.in");
	int n;
	read >> n;
	vector<Cow> cows(n);
	for (Cow &c : cows) { read >> c.start >> c.end >> c.buckets; }

	// The maximum number of buckets needed
	int max_buckets = 0;

	/*
	 * For each possible time, check how many buckets are needed at that time
	 * and update the maximum accordingly
	 */
	for (int t = 1; t <= MAX_TIME; t++) {
		int curr_buckets = 0;
		for (const Cow &c : cows) {
			if (c.start <= t && t <= c.end) { curr_buckets += c.buckets; }
		}
		max_buckets = std::max(max_buckets, curr_buckets);
	}

	std::ofstream("blist.out") << max_buckets << endl;
}
```

</CPPSection>
<JavaSection>

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class BList {
	static final int MAX_TIME = 1000;

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio("blist");
		int n = io.nextInt();
		int[][] cows = new int[n][];
		for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
			cows[c] = new int[] {io.nextInt(), io.nextInt(), io.nextInt()};
		}

		// The maximum number of buckets needed
		int maxBuckets = 0;

		/*
		 * For each possible time, check how many buckets are needed at that
		 * time and update the maximum accordingly
		 */
		for (int t = 1; t <= MAX_TIME; t++) {
			int currBuckets = 0;
			for (int[] c : cows) {
				if (c[0] <= t && t <= c[1]) { currBuckets += c[2]; }
			}
			maxBuckets = Math.max(maxBuckets, currBuckets);
		}

		io.println(maxBuckets);
		io.close();
	}

	// CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

<PySection>

```py
MAX_TIME = 1000

with open("blist.in") as read:
	n = int(read.readline())
	cows = [[int(i) for i in read.readline().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# The maximum number of buckets needed
max_buckets = 0

"""
For each possible time, check how many buckets are needed at that time
and update the maximum accordingly
"""
for t in range(1, MAX_TIME + 1):
	curr_buckets = 0
	for c in cows:
		if c[0] <= t <= c[1]:
			curr_buckets += c[2]
	max_buckets = max(max_buckets, curr_buckets)

print(max_buckets, file=open("blist.out", "w"))
```

</LanguageSection>

## Implementation 2 - Sweep

**Time Complexity** $\mathcal{O}(N + T)$

Solution 1 does a lot of unnecessary work, as we don't actually have to
recount the buckets for every time step.
This implementation keeps track of all the changes in milking times and iterates
through all the time steps at once.

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

const int MAX_TIME = 1000;

int main() {
	std::ifstream read("blist.in");
	int n;
	read >> n;

	vector<int> change(MAX_TIME + 1);
	for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
		int start, end;
		int amt;
		read >> start >> end >> amt;

		// at the start, we'll need some additional buckets
		change[start] += amt;
		// at the end, those buckets are no longer needed
		change[end] -= amt;
	}

	int max_buckets = 0;  // the maximum number of buckets needed
	int curr_buckets =
	    0;  // # of buckets we need at the current processing time
	for (int t = 0; t < MAX_TIME; t++) {
		// update the # of buckets we're using
		curr_buckets += change[t];
		// update the maximum accordingly
		max_buckets = std::max(max_buckets, curr_buckets);
	}

	std::ofstream("blist.out") << max_buckets << endl;
}
```

			// at the start, we'll need some additional buckets

		}

		int maxBuckets = 0;  // max # of buckets we'll need

		    0;  // # of buckets we need at the current processing time
