## Solution 1

## Solution 2 - Generating All Permutations

We can map the games to every possible permutation of the moves (hoof, paper, scissors) and find the sequence which gives us the maximum wins. This works because $1 \leq N \leq 100$.

### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<LanguageSection>
<PySection>

```py
from itertools import permutations
import sys

sys.stdin = open("hps.in", "r")
sys.stdout = open("hps.out", "w")

n = int(input())
games = []

games = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# 1 = Hoof, 2 = Paper, 3 = Scissors
choices = [1, 2, 3]

# in these cases, cow 1 wins
# hoof -> scissors -> paper -> hoof
scenarios = [[1, 3], [3, 2], [2, 1]]

# generates all permutations
pers = list(permutations(choices, 3))
maxwins = 0

# for every permutation, we cycle through
# each game and calculate the wins.
for j in pers:
	# resetting the wins counter
	wins = 0
	for i in games:
		selection = [j[i[0] - 1], j[i[1] - 1]]
		if selection in scenarios:
			wins += 1
	# refreshing the maximum
	maxwins = max(maxwins, wins)

print(maxwins)
```
