<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

Let's first try to find the minimum.
How many moves does it take at most to group the cows in consecutive locations?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Now let's try to find the maximum.
Each move reduces the gap between the two endpoints by a certain amount.
In order to maximize the number of steps, we just have to minimize the amount of gaps reduced after each move.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 3">

When there are two consecutive cows, what is the optimal way to move the cow that minimizes the amount of gaps reduced?

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("herding.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("herding.out", "w", stdout);

	// all cow locations
	vector<int> a;
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		int b;
		cin >> b;
		a.push_back(b);
	}
	sort(a.begin(), a.end());

	/*
	 * The minimum number of moves can only be 0, 1, or 2.
	 * 0 is if they're already consecutive,
	 * 1 is if there's a difference of 2 between any 2 numbers,
	 * and 2 is for all other cases.
	 */
	if (a[0] == a[2] - 2) {
		cout << 0 << endl;
	} else if ((a[1] == a[2] - 2) || (a[0] == a[1] - 2)) {
		cout << 1 << endl;
	} else {
		cout << 2 << endl;
	}
	// max is equal to largest difference between end and middle, minus one.
	cout << max(a[2] - a[1], a[1] - a[0]) - 1;
}
```

a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

# Best scenario: the three elements are already in order.
if c == a + 2:
	print(0)
	"""
	If there is a difference by 2, it can be solved in one move.
	3 5 9 -> 5 7 9
	"""
elif b == a + 2 or c == b + 2:
	print(1)
	"""
	It can always be solved in two moves by moving a -> c - 2 and b -> c - 1.
	If there is less than one integer between the two elements, it'll be taken care
	of in the if statement above.
	"""
else:
	print(2)
	"""
	The worst case is incrementing by 1 in the largest gap.
	3 5 9 -> 5 6 9 -> 6 7 9 -> 7 8 9
	"""
print(max(b - a, c - b) - 1)
