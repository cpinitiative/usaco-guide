## Explanation

Observe that when a cow is added, at most five cows can become comfortable or uncomfortable: the newly added cow and any adjacent cows that exist in each of the four directions. We can create a function to check whether or not there is a comfortable cow in a certain position. We also maintain a set of comfortable cows. After adding a cow, we check whether each of the five positions contains a comfortable cow using our function and update the set accordingly. Finally, we print the length of the set of comfortable cows for each query.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```py
n = int(input())

def check_comfortable(x, y):
    if not cows[x][y]:
        return
    adjacent = 0
    for cow in [(x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x, y + 1)]:
        if cows[cow[0]][cow[1]]:
            adjacent += 1
    return adjacent == 3

cows = [[False] * 1001 for i in range(1001)]
comfortable = set()
for i in range(n):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    cows[x][y] = True

    for cow in [(x, y), (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x, y + 1)]:
        if check_comfortable(cow[0], cow[1]):
            comfortable.add(cow)
        else:
            comfortable.discard(cow)

    print(len(comfortable))
```
