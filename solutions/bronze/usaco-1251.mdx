## Explanation

Basically, the solution is using sorting and for loop to find the max tuition. I will explain it one by one. First, the type should be assigned as long long since the max tuition and the best tuition on that specific point
can exceed the range of -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647. The number of cows can be 1 to 100,000, while the maximum tuition varies from 1 to 1,000,000. Multiplying both numbers exceeds the range, so the array and variables that will
hold the maxTuition and bestTuition on that specific point should be assigned with long long rather than int form. After assigning the variables, the number of cows and the maximum tuition that each cow is willing to pay
should be plugged in.
Next, the array that contains the maximum tuition that each cow is willing to pay should be sorted. The reason is to find easily find the best tuition. By sorting the array, we can have the arrangement beginning
with the smallest fee that the cow wills pay and ending with the biggest fee that the cow wills pay. We can easily calculate the amount of total money that can be generated by this array because the index of the array and the max tuition is related.
For example, starting with the zero position of the array, by multiplying the number of cows that will pay a bigger amount of tuition compared to the cow at the zero position with the tuition that the cow at the zero position wills pay
, we can easily know the best tuition that the cows can pay. After calculating the zero position, by moving to the next position which is the first position, again we can simply multiply the number of cows that will pay a bigger amount
of tuition compared to the cow at the first position, which will be substracting -1 from the value of the previous example, with the tuition that the cow at the first position wills to pay. By comparing the first and second values that we have
calculated through this example, we can know the best tuition that the cows can pay. The number of cows that will pay bigger tuition than the cow at a certain index could be easily calculated through sorting, and this is the
point why sorting is crucial in this problem. By sorting it, we can know the value of the number of cows that will pay bigger tuition that the cow at a certain index by subtracting the index value from the length of the array.
For example, if I want to find out how many cows are willing to pay the tuition that the cow at index 2 wants to pay, I could easily do this by sorting the array and subtracting 2 from the length of the array because all of the cows
that have a bigger index than 2 will be able to pay the fee since we sorted it. By comparing these values, we can have the maximum amount of tuition that the cows can pay which is indicated as the best tuition.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(Nlog N)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	long long maxTuition[n];
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> maxTuition[i]; }

	sort(maxTuition, maxTuition + n);

	long long maxMoney = 0,
	          bestTuition =
	              0;  // Need to use long long form rather than int as the 10^5
	                  // times 10^6 exceeds the range of integer.
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		long long setTuitionToIthCow =
		    maxTuition[i] *
		    (n - i);  // (n - i) is used to calculate the number of cows that
		              // are willing to pay the fee.
		if (setTuitionToIthCow >
		    maxMoney) {  // the if statement changes the best tuition only if
			             // the calculated value is bigger than the maximum
			             // value that is calculated throughout the for loop.
			maxMoney = setTuitionToIthCow;
			bestTuition = maxTuition[i];
		}
	}

	cout << maxMoney << " " << bestTuition << endl;

	return 0;
}
```
