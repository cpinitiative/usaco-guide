<Info title="Info/Tips">
Oftentimes, problems will try to trick you. For example, since the judge is asking for a double, you would assume you may need to some advanced geometry or some diagonal movements, but a good rule of thumb is to always stay simple: the most elegant and more importantly the fastest solutions are the shortest.

## Explanation

Let's call:
* $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ the leftmost and rightmost points of table 1 respectively
* $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ the bottommost and topmost points of table 1 respectively
* $w_{1}$ and $h_{1}$ the width and height of table 1 (equal to the difference in $x_{1}$ and $x_
  {2}$ and $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ respectively)
* $w_{2}$ and $h_{2}$ the width and height of table 2 respectively
* $W$ and $H$ the width and height of the room respectively

The key to this problem is realising that table 2 will only ever be in 4 different positions
relative to table 1: to its left, right, top or bottom (see diagram below). In addition, in all
cases we can assume that table 2 will be touching its respective wall in order to (attempt) to
maximise its distance from table 1. E.g., if placing table 2 to the left of table 1, we will
assume its leftmost edge will be touching the left wall of the room. Determining the solution is
then simply a case of simulating all of these cases and finding which involves moving table 1 the smallest distance.

Possible placements of table 2 relative to table 1.

To determine the minimum distance that table 1 must be moved, we have to calculate the overlap
between the two tables. For example:

![](cf-1555B\CF1555B-2.png)

In this case, table 2 is placed to the left of table 1. We can therefore calculate its overlap
with table 1 as follows: $w$ - $x_{1}$. Here the overlap is 1, meaning we
must move table 1 one space from its starting position to fit table 2 in the room. We must then
compare this answer to the answers we get from placing table 2 to the right, top or bottom of
table 1. The smallest of all of these is our final answer.

To summarise, we calculate the overlap of the two tables as follows:
* Table 2 placed to the left of table 1: Overlap = $w$ - $x_{1}$
* Table 2 placed to the right of table 1: Overlap = $x_{2}$ - ($W$ - $w$)
* Table 2 placed to the top of table 1: Overlap = $y_{2}$ - ($H$ - $h$)
* Table 2 placed to the bottom of table 1: Overlap = $h$ - $y_{1}$

It is possible that the two tables don't overlap at all. In this case the above calculations
would return a negative number so we should instead return 0 to indicate that table 1 doesn't
have to move at all.

<Warning>
When placing table 2 on the left and right sides, make sure $w_{1} + w_{2} \leq W$,
otherwise table 2 won't fit in the room.
Similarly, when placing table 2 on the top and bottom sides, make sure $h_{1} + h_{2} \leq H$,
otherwise table 2 won't fit in the room.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int tc;
	cin >> tc;
	for (int i = 0; i < tc; i++) {
		int total_width, total_height;
		cin >> total_width >> total_height;

		int x1, y1, x2, y2;
		cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

		int w1 = x2 - x1;
		int h1 = y2 - y1;

		int w2, h2;
		cin >> w2 >> h2;

		// Calculating min and max X and Y values needed to fit in their places
		int left_place = w2;
		int right_place = total_width - w2;
		int top_place = total_height - h2;
		int bottom_place = h2;

		// Calculating distance needed to move first rectangle
		int amount_needed_left = max(left_place - x1, 0);
		int amount_needed_right = max(x2 - right_place, 0);
		int amount_needed_top = max(y2 - top_place, 0);
		int amount_needed_bottom = max(bottom_place - y1, 0);

		// Checking bounds of the rectangles
		if (w1 + w2 > total_width) {
			amount_needed_left = INT32_MAX;
			amount_needed_right = INT32_MAX;
		}

		if (h1 + h2 > total_height) {
			amount_needed_top = INT32_MAX;
			amount_needed_bottom = INT32_MAX;
		}

		// neat trick to get the min out of multiple elements
		int ans = min({amount_needed_left, amount_needed_right,
		               amount_needed_top, amount_needed_bottom});

		// if the rectangles can't fit in the bigger rectangles in any way,
		// print -1
		cout << (ans == INT32_MAX ? -1 : ans) << endl;
	}
}
