## Video Solution

## Explanation

[Official Analysis (Java)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_angry_bronze_jan16.html)

Since there's at most 100 haybales, we can try launching a cow at every single
one and simulate the aftermath.

Implementing the explosions can get a little nasty, though, so to make
things easier we can notice that the explosions on the left and right side
are completely independent from each other.

Consider a situation where the haybales are $[3, 4, 5]$.
We'll refer to them by their positions for convenience.

If we launch a cow at the haybale $4$, although $5$ is able
to blow up $3$ with an explosion of radius $2$, $3$ was already going
to explode anyway from $4$'s explosion of radius $1$.

This observation allows us to check the farthest the explosion can reach on both sides
and then add up the results for our final answer.

<Warning>

The solution from the official analysis is incorrect on the following input:

```
3
3
5
6
```

It outputs 2, but the correct answer is 3.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int N;
vector<int> bales;

int exploded_num(int start, int direction) {
	int radius = 1;
	int prev = start;
	while (true) {
		int next = prev;
		// Get the furthest explosion index without exceeding the current radius
		while (next + direction >= 0 && next + direction < N &&
		       abs(bales[next + direction] - bales[prev]) <= radius) {
			next += direction;
		}

		// We didn't find a new haybale, so the chain explosion is over
		if (next == prev) { break; }

		// Update our previous explosion and increment radius
		prev = next;
		radius++;
	}

	return abs(prev - start);
}

int main() {
	freopen("angry.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("angry.out", "w", stdout);

	cin >> N;
	bales.resize(N);
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { cin >> bales[i]; }

	sort(bales.begin(), bales.end());
	int max_exploded = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		// Get the number of exploded bales for the left & right side
		max_exploded = max(max_exploded, exploded_num(i, -1) + exploded_num(i, 1) + 1);
	}

	cout << max_exploded << endl;
}
```
