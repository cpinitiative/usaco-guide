## Explanation

We denote a "desirable location" of a cow as a location where a cow of that species will be checked by the bovine veterinarian.

We denote a "contribution" as one instance of a cow being moved to a desirable location.

We observe that for a given operation with endpoints $l$ and $r$, an operation with endpoints $l - 1$ and $r + 1$ moves the cows from $l$ to $r$ to the same locations, and also swaps $l - 1$ and $r + 1$. Therefore, only the two newly added endpoints can change whether a cow is in a desirable location.

![](usaco-1469/expansion.png)

Thus, we can start at all operations where $l = r$, then gradually expand the operations by decrementing $l$ and incrementing $r$ until the operation is no longer valid, and calculate how many contributions are added by the endpoints each time we expand our operation. This only calculates all odd-length operations, so we do the same starting from $l = r - 1$, to calculate all even-length operations.

An expansion can either add or subtract a contribution:
1. It can add a contribution by moving a cow from a previously undesirable location to a desirable location.
2. It can subtract a contribution by moving a cow from a previously desirable location to an undesirable location.

This can be checked with a few simple if statements during iteration.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);

	int num_cows;
	cin >> num_cows;

	vector<int> initial_order(num_cows);

	for (int i = 0; i < num_cows; i++) { cin >> initial_order[i]; }

	vector<int> ideal_order(num_cows);

	for (int i = 0; i < num_cows; i++) { cin >> ideal_order[i]; }

	// Store number of operations resulting in N cows being checked as an array where
	// operations[N cows checked] = number of operations
	vector<int> operations(num_cows + 1);

	// Calculate amount of cows already in a desirable location
	int correct_placement = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < num_cows; i++) {
		if (initial_order[i] == ideal_order[i]) { correct_placement++; }
	}

	// Odd-length subarray iteration
	for (int i = 0; i < num_cows; i++) {
		int left = i;
		int right = i;

		// current_placement = (# cows moved into correct positions) - (# cows moved out
		// of correct positions)
		int current_placement = 0;

		while (left >= 0 and right < num_cows) {
			if (initial_order[left] == ideal_order[right]) { current_placement++; }

			if (initial_order[right] == ideal_order[left]) { current_placement++; }

			if (initial_order[left] == ideal_order[left]) { current_placement--; }

			if (initial_order[right] == ideal_order[right]) { current_placement--; }

			operations[current_placement + correct_placement]++;

			left--;
			right++;
		}
	}

	// Even-length subarray iteration
	for (int i = 1; i < num_cows; i++) {
		int left = i - 1;
		int right = i;

		// current_placement = (# cows moved into correct positions) - (# cows moved out
		// of correct positions)
		int current_placement = 0;

		while (left >= 0 and right < num_cows) {
			if (initial_order[left] == ideal_order[right]) { current_placement++; }

			if (initial_order[right] == ideal_order[left]) { current_placement++; }

			if (initial_order[left] == ideal_order[left]) { current_placement--; }

			if (initial_order[right] == ideal_order[right]) { current_placement--; }

			operations[current_placement + correct_placement]++;

			left--;
			right++;
		}
	}

	for (int op : operations) { cout << op << "\n"; }
}
