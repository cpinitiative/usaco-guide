## Solution (Vector Cross Product)

To find the area of a triangle with a vertex at $(0, 0)$, a second vertex at
$(x_1, y_1)$ and third vertex at $(x_2, y_2)$, we can use the formula
$\frac{x_1y_2 - y_1x_2}{2}$. This value is positive if $\frac{x_1}{y_1}$ is
greater than $\frac{x_2}{y_2}$, since the slope becomes smaller, making it
clockwise. Likewise, a negative area means the direction is counterclockwise.

In the program, every time Farmer John lays down another fence, a new triangle
is formed with his new position, the origin, and the previous position (the last
fence he laid down). We can calculate the area of this new triangle. After he
lays down all the fences, we can sum the areas of the multiple triangles to find
if the final direction was positive (clockwise) or negative (counterclockwise).

The [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product) of two vectors
is twice the signed area of the triangle between them. Every time Farmer John
lays down a fence, we can treat it as a vector and compute the cross product of
this vector against the previous one. By adding the cross products together, we
get twice the final area of the polygon formed by these vectors. Based on the
sign of the area, we can know if it's counterclockwise or clockwise (vector
directing up or down with the right hand rule). The process is also how the
shoelace formula is proved.

## Implementation

```py
def cross_product(p1, p2):
	return p1[0] * p2[1] - p2[0] * p1[1]


for i in range(int(input())):
	p0 = (0, 0)
	sum = 0
	direction = input()
	for d in direction:
		if d == "N":
			p1 = (p0[0], p0[1] + 1)
		elif d == "E":
			p1 = (p0[0] + 1, p0[1])
		elif d == "S":
			p1 = (p0[0], p0[1] - 1)
		else:
			p1 = (p0[0] - 1, p0[1])
		sum += cross_product(p1, p0)
		p0 = p1

	if sum > 0:
		print("CW")
	else:
		print("CCW")
```
