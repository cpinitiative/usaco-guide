## Explanation

We can do a simple brute force to find out which milk could possibly be bad, and
then see how many people that milk could have infected in total.

Since FJ needs one medicine for each person who could possibly get sick, we can
just take the maximum possible number of infected people over all milk types
that could have possibly gone bad.

The main issue is checking if a milk could have been the one that went bad. To
resolve this, let's treat both a person drinking milk and a person getting sick
as a type of _event_. Then, we can have a list of events sorted by time. Note
that sick events must be before drinking events if they occur at the same time
because one can only get sick if they drank the milk at a _strictly_ earlier
point in time. The sample case in this format would be as follows:

<center>

| Time | Person | Drink |
| :--: | :----: | :---: |
|  1   |   1    |   1   |
|  1   |   1    |   4   |
|  2   |   1    |   2   |
|  3   |   1    |  NA   |
|  3   |   3    |   1   |
|  4   |   1    |   3   |
|  5   |   2    |   1   |
|  7   |   2    |   2   |
|  8   |   2    |  NA   |

</center>

With this list of events, we can then go through marking the people that could
have possibly gotten sick and checking each event where a person got sick if
they could have possibly gotten sick.
