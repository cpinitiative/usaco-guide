## Explanation

Observe that the final state of a character at a certain position is determined by the number of Os typed after it. If it is even, the flips that modify this character will cancel out, so the final state will be the original character as typed. Otherwise, it will be flipped. Note that this means the last character of the answer string must be the last character of the input string, because there are no O characters after it to flip it.

We can solve this problem by building the string in reverse. We can determine whether to flip each character or not based on the parity of number of O characters that will come after it. Essentially, the only thing that matters when determining a final character is the Os after it, so we can build the string from right to left accordingly. Clearly, through this method, we will always be able to construct a valid answer (the answer is always YES).

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```py
t, k = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(t):
	n = int(input())
	string = input()
	print("YES")
	if k == 1:
		o_count = 0
		ans = [""] * n
		for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
			if o_count % 2 == 0:
				ans[i] = string[i]
			else:
				ans[i] = "O" if string[i] == "M" else "M"
			if ans[i] == "O":
				o_count += 1
		print("".join(ans))
```
