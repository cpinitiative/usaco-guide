## Explanation

We process the branches from lowest to highest, calculating for each branch
the amount of area it has that is not covered by a subsequent one.
Looking at the image of the sample case given in the problem statement, we would
be calculating the area outlined in black for each branch.

For each branch, there are two cases:
1. No branch covers the current one.
   In this case, we add $\frac{dh}{2}$ to the total, as that is the formula for the area of a triangle.
2. A branch covers the current one, turning it into a trapezoid.
   In this case, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezoid,
   which is $\frac{h(b_1+b_2)}{2}$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths
   of the top and bottom bases.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

/** @return the area of a trapezoid with the given base lens and height */
double trap_area(double base1, double base2, double height) {
	return height * (base1 + base2) / 2;
}

int main() {
	int test_num;
	std::cin >> test_num;

	cout << std::setprecision(17);
	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) {
		int branch_num;
		int base;
		int height;
		std::cin >> branch_num >> base >> height;

		vector<int> offsets(branch_num);
		for (int &o : offsets) { std::cin >> o; }
		std::sort(offsets.begin(), offsets.end());

		double total_area = 0;
		double slope = (double)base / height;
		for (int b = 0; b < branch_num; b++) {
			if (b == branch_num - 1 || offsets[b] + height <= offsets[b + 1]) {
				total_area += (double)base * height / 2;
				continue;
			}

			int height_diff = offsets[b + 1] - offsets[b];
			double new_base = (double)base - slope * height_diff;
			total_area += trap_area(base, new_base, height_diff);
		}

		cout << std::setprecision(17) << total_area << '\n';
	}
}
```

```py
def trap_area(base1: float, base2: float, height: float) -> float:
	""":return: the area of a trapezoid with the given base lens and height"""
	return height * (base1 + base2) / 2


for _ in range(int(input())):
	branch_num, base, height = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
	offsets = sorted(int(i) for i in input().split())
	assert branch_num == len(offsets)

	total_area = 0
	slope = base / height
	for b in range(branch_num):
		if b == branch_num - 1 or offsets[b] + height <= offsets[b + 1]:
			total_area += base * height / 2
			continue

		height_diff = offsets[b + 1] - offsets[b]
		new_base = base - slope * height_diff
		total_area += trap_area(base, new_base, height_diff)

	print(total_area)
