## Explanation

After we sort the input, an important observation is that if Bessie is at position $x$, then the number of cows lying are all the
cows with position less than $x$ that says "L" plus all the cows with a position greater than $x$ that says
"G".

Given this, we can loop through every cow's position and compute the total number
of liars by using a forwards loop and a backwards loop.

The answer is the minimum liars over all the positions we looped over.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	vector<pair<int, char>> cows(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		// The position is read into .first for sorting.
		cin >> cows[i].second >> cows[i].first;
	}

	sort(cows.begin(), cows.end());

	/*
	 * lying_left[i] stores the number of cows to the left of cow i
	 * that must be lying given that Bessie is at the position of cow i.
	 */
	vector<int> lying_left(n);
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		// Add up all the cows that are already lying to the left of our pos.
		lying_left[i] += lying_left[i - 1];

		if (cows[i - 1].second == 'L' && cows[i].first > cows[i - 1].first) {
			/*
			 * If the cow before says our position is to the left
			 * but their position is strictly less than our position,
			 * they're lying.
			 */
			lying_left[i]++;
		}
	}

	/*
	 * lying_right stores the same thing, but does it so for the cows
	 * to the *right* of i.
	 */
	vector<int> lying_right(n);
	// Fill it up in much the same way.
	for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
		lying_right[i] += lying_right[i + 1];

		if (cows[i + 1].second == 'G' && cows[i].first < cows[i + 1].first) {
			lying_right[i]++;
		}
	}

	int min_liars = n;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		min_liars = min(min_liars, lying_left[i] + lying_right[i]);
	}

	cout << min_liars << endl;
