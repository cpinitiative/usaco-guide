## Explanation

At each step, we check where Farmer John starts and where he's trying to go. If his path doesn't overlap with
Bessie's path, we add the distance he covers to a running total and move him to his starting position.
On the other hand, if his path somehow overlaps with Bessie's, we add only his distance from Bessie to the total.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log|x - y|)$

<Spoiler title="Proof">

Let's say the distance between Farmer John and Bessie is $D = |x - y|$.
In each step, Farmer John travels double the distance he traveled in the previous step: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \cdots$.
We can see how the the distance grows exponentially.

Farmer John will find Bessie when the range of his movement includes her position.
This happens when the distance he travels in a single step, $2^k$, becomes at least $D$.

Mathematically, this means $2^k \ge D \implies k \ge \log_2 D$.

Thus, the number of steps needed to find Bessie is proportional to $\log_2(D)$, making the overall time complexity what it is.
