<Info title="TLE">

Due to Python's slow speed, this approach doesn't pass all test cases.

<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

What's the best strategy that Bessie could use if, hypothetically, there wasn't a speed limit at the finish line?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 1 (answer)">

We'd want to increase our speed as much as we can!

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

How can we use this strategy when there **is** a speed limit?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 2 (answer)">

We'll have Bessie continuously speed up until she's forced to slow down because of the speed limit.
This strategy works because we've observed that when possible, Bessie should always speed up!

This is an example of a [greedy algorithm](/bronze/intro-greedy).
