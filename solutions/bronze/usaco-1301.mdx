## Explanation

We solve this problem with a greedy algorithm.

First, we iterate through all the days.
On the first day, Bessie will always have to buy a new subscription.
However, on subsequent days, there's two cases:
1. It's better to extend the last subscription.
   This occurs when the cost of extending the last subscription, calculated by
   subtracting the date of the last one from the current day, is less than $K$.
2. If the previous condition isn't met, it's better to start a new subscription entirely.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	int k;
	cin >> n >> k;

	vector<long long> days(n);
	for (long long &d : days) { cin >> d; }

	long long last_day = days[0];
	long long cost = k + 1;  // Start the first subscription
	for (long long d : days) {
		// Should Bessie extend the most recent subscription?
		if (d - last_day < k + 1) {
			cost += d - last_day;
		} else {
			// Or just start a new one entirely?
			cost += k + 1;
		}

		// Store the date of the last subscription
		last_day = d;
	}

	cout << cost << endl;
}
```

public class WatchingMooloo {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String[] input = br.readLine().split(" ");
		int n = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
		int k = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);

		long[] days = new long[n];
		String[] daysInput = br.readLine().split(" ");
		br.close();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { days[i] = Long.parseLong(daysInput[i]); }

		long lastDay = days[0];
		long cost = k + 1;  // Start the first subscription
		for (long d : days) {
			// Should Bessie extend the most recent subscription?
			if (d - lastDay < k + 1) {
				cost += d - lastDay;
			} else {
				// Or just start a new one entirely?
				cost += k + 1;
			}

			// Store the date of the last subscription
			lastDay = d;
		}

		System.out.println(cost);
	}
}
```

<PySection>

```py
n, k = map(int, input().split())
days = list(map(int, input().split()))

last_day = days[0]
cost = k + 1  # Start the first subscription

for d in days:
	# Should Bessie extend the most recent subscription?
	if d - last_day < k + 1:
		cost += d - last_day
	else:
		# Or just start a new one entirely?
		cost += k + 1

	# Store the date of the last subscription
	last_day = d

print(cost)
```
