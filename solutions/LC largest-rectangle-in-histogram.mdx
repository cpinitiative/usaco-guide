title: LeetCode Largest Rectangle in Histogram

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N)$.

The largest rectangle must have the same height as the shortest bar that it contains. For each $i$, consider the largest rectangle with height $H[i]$ such that bar $i$ is the shortest bar it contains. The answer is simply the largest of these $N$ rectangles.

Since the heights of these rectangles are fixed, we just want them to be as wide as possible. Notice how the rectangle of bar $i$ is bounded by the the closest shorter bars on each side of bar $i$ (or the ends of the histogram if these bars don't exist).

We can use a monotone stack twice to find the closest shorter bars on each side of each bar. See [the stacks module](https://usaco.guide/gold/stacks#application-nearest-smaller-element) for more details.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        int n = heights.size();
        if (!n) return 0;
        stack<int> stck;
        vector<int> area(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (stck.size() && heights[stck.top()] >= heights[i]) stck.pop();
            int width = i - (stck.size() ? stck.top() : -1);
            area[i] += width * heights[i];
            stck.push(i);
        }
        while (stck.size()) stck.pop();
        for (int i = n - 1; ~i; i--) {
            while (stck.size() && heights[stck.top()] >= heights[i]) stck.pop();
            int width = (stck.size() ? stck.top() : n) - i;
            area[i] += (width - 1) * heights[i];
            stck.push(i);
        }
        return *max_element(area.begin(), area.end());
    }
};
