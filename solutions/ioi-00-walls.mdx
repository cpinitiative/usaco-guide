title: Walls

## Explanation

Rather than treating the towns as nodes, instead treat the regions themselves as nodes with
the walls as the edges still.
We perform BFS from each node, logging the minimum distance from every region to every other region.
Finally, we try all meeting regions and print out the one that minimizes the number of walls the members have to cross.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(M^2 L)$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

using std::pair;

int main() {
	int region_num;
	int town_num;
	int member_num;
	std::cin >> region_num >> town_num >> member_num;

	vector<int> members(member_num);
	for (int& m : members) {
		std::cin >> m;
		m--;
	}
	vector<vector<int>> town_regions(town_num);
	// contains the walls (represented as a pair of towns) for each region
	vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> regions(region_num);
	for (int r = 0; r < region_num; r++) {
		int border_num;
		std::cin >> border_num;
		vector<int> towns(border_num);
		for (int& t : towns) {
			std::cin >> t;
			t--;
			town_regions[t].push_back(r);
		}
		for (int t = 0; t < border_num; t++) {
			regions[r].push_back({towns[t], towns[(t + 1) % border_num]});
		}
	}
	// the walls previously processed (along with their associated regions)
	std::map<pair<int, int>, int> prev_walls;
	vector<vector<int>> neighbors(region_num);
	for (int r = 0; r < region_num; r++) {
		for (const pair<int, int>& w : regions[r]) {
			// if we've seen this wall before, add that associated region
			if (prev_walls.count(w)) {
				// dupes might happen but that doesn't really matter
				neighbors[r].push_back(prev_walls[w]);
				neighbors[prev_walls[w]].push_back(r);
			} else {
				prev_walls[w] = r;
				pair<int, int> reverse{w.second, w.first};
				prev_walls[reverse] = r;
			}
		}
	}

	vector<vector<int>> min_crossings(region_num, vector<int>(region_num));
	// BFS from each region and log the minimum distances
	for (int start = 0; start < region_num; start++) {
		int moves = 0;
		vector<bool> visited(region_num);
		vector<int> frontier{start};
		visited[start] = true;
		while (!frontier.empty()) {
			vector<int> in_line;
			moves++;
			for (int r : frontier) {
				for (int n : neighbors[r]) {
					if (!visited[n]) {
						min_crossings[start][n] = moves;
						visited[n] = true;
						in_line.push_back(n);
					}
				}
			}
			frontier = in_line;
		}
	}

	// get the best meeting region through brute force
	int min_crossing_sum = INT32_MAX;
	int best_region = -1;
	for (int meeting = 0; meeting < region_num; meeting++) {
		int this_min_cross = 0;
		for (int m : members) {
			int m_min_crossings = INT32_MAX;
			for (int t : town_regions[m]) {
				m_min_crossings = std::min(m_min_crossings, min_crossings[t][meeting]);
			}
			this_min_cross += m_min_crossings;
		}
		if (this_min_cross < min_crossing_sum) {
			min_crossing_sum = this_min_cross;
			best_region = meeting;
		}
	}
	cout << min_crossing_sum << endl << best_region + 1 << endl;
}
