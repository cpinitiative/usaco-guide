## Solution 2
We can iterate through the favorite pastures, and increment one to the pasture with the greater index, making the result minimal. All pastures start with 
the seed choice as one, this makes it so that we don't have to worry about decreasing or increasing more to a certain pasture. We'll also cycle through the 
previous favorite pastures to make sure that our new alteration doesn't interfere with any of the other cow's favorite pastures.

## Implementation - Solution 2
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

```py
import sys
sys.stdin = open('revegetate.in', 'r')
sys.stdout = open('revegetate.out', 'w')

pasture_num, cow_num = map(int, input().split())
pastures = []
ans = [1] * pasture_num

for _ in range(cow_num):
	past1, past2 = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
	# Subtract one so that the indexes start from 0
	pastures.append([past1 - 1, past2 - 1])

# Assign the pastures at the front first.
pastures.sort()
for a, b in pastures:
	# If they're not unique.
	if ans[a] == ans[b]:
		# Increment one to the pasture closer to the end.
		# 100 is larger than 001.
		ans[b] += 1

		# All favorite pastures up to the current one.
		for i, j in pastures[:pastures.index([a, b])]:
			# Increment again if requirement isn't satisfied.
			# This also means that either i == b or j == b, 
			# since the only reason they would become equal again	
			# is if they had a pasture in common.
			if ans[i] == ans[j]:
				ans[b] += 1
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
