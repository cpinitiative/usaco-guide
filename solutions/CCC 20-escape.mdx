<!-- No need to prime factorize! -->

Define `grid[r][c]` to be the integer in the $r$-th row of the $c$-th column of
the input grid. Let `done[x]=true` if we can reach any cell $(r,c)$ such that
$r\cdot c=x$ and `false` otherwise. If `done[x]` is `true`, then we also know
that `done[grid[r][c]]` is `true` for all cells $(r,c)$ such that $r\cdot c=x$.

So we essentially have a directed graph with vertices $1\ldots 10^6$ where there
exists a directed edge from `x` to `grid[r][c]` whenever $r\cdot c=x$. We want
to test whether there exists a path from $1$ to $N\cdot M$ in this graph.

Thus, we can simply start DFSing from vertex $1$ and mark all the vertices that
we visit in the boolean array `done`. If we set `done[N*M]=true`, then a path
exists, and we can terminate after printing "yes." Note that in the code below,
`todo[x]` denotes the adjacency list of `x`.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int M, N;
vector<int> todo[1000005];
bool done[1000005];

void dfs(int x) {
	if (done[x]) {
		return;
	}
	if (x == N * M) {
		cout << "yes" << endl;
		exit(0);
	}
	done[x] = 1;
	for (int& t : todo[x]) {
		dfs(t);
	}
}

int main() {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin >> M >> N;
	for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
		for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
			int x;
			cin >> x;
			todo[i * j].push_back(x);
		}
	}
	dfs(1);
	cout << "no" << endl;
}
```
