<!-- No need to prime factorize! -->

Define `grid[r][c]` to be the integer in the $r$-th row of the $c$-th column of the input grid. Let `done[x]=true` if we can reach any cell $(r,c)$ such that $r\cdot c=x$ and `false` otherwise. If `done[x]` is `true`, then we also know that `done[grid[r][c]]` is `true` for all cells $(r,c)$ such that $r\cdot c=x$.

So we essentially have a directed graph with vertices $1\ldots 10^6$ where there exists a directed edge from `x` to `grid[r][c]` whenever $r\cdot c=x$. We want to test whether there exists a path from $1$ to $N\cdot M$ in this graph.

Thus, we can simply start DFSing from vertex $1$ and mark all the vertices that we visit in the boolean array `done`. If we set `done[N*M]=true`, then a path exists, and we can terminate after printing "yes." Note that in the code below, `todo[x]` denotes the adjacency list of `x`.

```cpp
int M,N;
vi todo[1000005];
bool done[1000005];

void dfs(int x) {
	if (done[x]) return;
	if (x == N*M) {
		ps("yes");
		exit(0);
	}
	done[x] = 1;
	trav(t,todo[x]) dfs(t);
}

int main() {
	setIO(); re(M,N);
	FOR(i,1,M+1) FOR(j,1,N+1) {
		int x; re(x);
		todo[i*j].pb(x);
	}
	dfs(1);
	ps("no");
}
```
