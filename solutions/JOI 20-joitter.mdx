The problem asks for the maximum number of followings after each social exchange
event, but is it even possible _not_ to achieve that maximum?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Consider the following scenario: there are $X$ people numbered $1$ to $X$, and
for each $2 \leq i \leq X$, people $i$ and $i - 1$ follow each other. What will
their followings look like after a social exchange event?

<Spoiler title="Hint 3">

Following from hint 2, what if there are another $Y$ people numbered $X + 1$ to
$X + Y$, and person $1$ follows person $X + 1$ while person $X + Y$ follows
person $X$?

We're dealing with a DSU-like structure, so small-to-large merging can
potentially be useful.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(M \log^2 N)$.

We'll always end up with the same number of followings after a social exchange
event regardless of the order in which we choose the triples $(x, y, z)$.

Consider the following graph:

- Nodes represent people on Joitter.
- There are two types of edges: red and blue.
  - Red edges are undirected and represent a mutual following
  - Blue edges are directed and represent a one-way following

The key observation is that if node $u$ can reach node $v$ using only red edges,
then they will be connected with a red edge after a social exchange event. This
suggests that we should use DSU to keep track of components of nodes connected
by red edges.

Furthermore, if we have two separate components $A$ and $B$, four nodes
$u_A, v_A \in A, u_B, v_B \in B$ (not necessarily distinct), and the blue edges
$u_A \rightarrow v_B$ and $u_B \rightarrow v_A$, then each pair of nodes in
$A \cup B$ will also have a red edge between them after a social exchange event.
This means that we should merge $A$ and $B$ in the DSU if this ever happens.

We can use small-to-large merging to keep track of blue edges between components
in $\mathcal O(M \log^2 N)$ time.

(Note that two components merging may cause other components also to merge, so
also keep a queue of which components need to merge.)

Although we have a nice structure for storing and merging components, we still
need to calculate the change in the answer each time two components $A$ and $B$
merge!

Let $V_i$ be the number of followings after the $i$-th merging, and let $F_S$ be
the set of people outside of the component $S$ that follow someone in $S$.

1. We need to subtract the number of followings from **inside** the
   previously-unmerged $A$ and $B$. Since each pair of people followed each
   other, this number is $|A| \cdot (|A| - 1) + |B| \cdot (|B| - 1)$.
2. We need to add the number of followings from **inside** the newly-merged
   $A \cup B$. Since each pair of people will follow each other, this number is
   $|A \cup B| \cdot (|A \cup B| - 1)$.
3. We need to add the number of followings from **outside** $A \cup B$. Since
   people who previously followed everyone in $A$ will now also follow everyone
   in $B$ and vice-versa, this number is $|A| \cdot |F_B| + |B| \cdot |F_A|$.
4. We need to subtract the number of followings from people who previously
   already followed everyone in both $A$ and $B$ or were already in $A$ or $B$.
   This number is $|(A \cup F_A) \cap (B \cup F_B)| \cdot |A \cup B|$.

Putting it all together and setting $C_S = S \cup F_S$, we get:

$$
V_i = V_{i - 1} + |A| \cdot |C_B| + |B| \cdot |C_A| - |C_A \cap C_B| \cdot |A \cup B|.
$$

We can use small-to-large merging again to keep track of each $C_S$ in
$\mathcal O(M \log^2 N)$ time.
