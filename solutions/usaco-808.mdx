[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_hoofball_bronze_feb18.html)

## Explanation

Find all source cows and cows which only pass to each other, and give a ball to each one.

## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

```py
import sys

balls = [0] * n
ans = 0

	If we find two cows which only pass to each other,
	we have to give them one as well.

		and balls[i] == 1 and balls[nearestneighbor(i)] == 1):
		ans += 1
