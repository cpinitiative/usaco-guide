[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_hoofball_bronze_feb18.html)

## Explanation

First, let's realize that Farmer John will need another ball in one of two cases: 
1. A cow is a source cow, or a cow that Farmer John first passses to. 
2. Two cows are close together, so they pass a ball back and forth endlessly and another ball is needed for other cows to hold. 

So, each time this occurs we can count it and return this total count as our answer once we're done. 
We can do this first by finding which cow, if any, every cow passes the ball to. 

## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open('hoofball.in', 'r')
sys.stdout = open('hoofball.out', 'w')

n = int(input())
cows = sorted(list(map(int, input().strip().split())))
balls = [0] * n
ans = 0

def nearestneighbor(ind):
	lnbr, rnbr = -1, -1
	ldist, rdist = 1000, 1000
	for i in range(n):
		"""
		If the cow we're looking at is on the left
		and it's closer to the target than the previous one.
		"""
		if cows[i] < cows[ind] and cows[ind] - cows[i] < ldist:
			lnbr = i
			ldist = cows[ind] - cows[i]
	for i in range(n):
		# same thing, but for the right.
		if cows[i] > cows[ind] and cows[i] - cows[ind] < rdist:
			rnbr = i
			rdist = cows[i] - cows[ind]
	return lnbr if ldist <= rdist else rnbr
    
for i in range(n):
	# all cows who receive a ball
	balls[nearestneighbor(i)] += 1
for i in range(n):
	"""
	if the cow isn't passed to by any of the neighbors,
	then we have to give it a ball.
	"""
	if balls[i] == 0:
		ans += 1
	"""
	If we find two cows which only pass to each other,
	we have to give them one as well.
	"""
	if (i < nearestneighbor(i) and nearestneighbor(nearestneighbor(i)) == i
		and balls[i] == 1 and balls[nearestneighbor(i)] == 1):
		ans += 1
    
print(ans)
