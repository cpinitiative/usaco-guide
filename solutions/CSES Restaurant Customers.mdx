In this problem, we're given $n$ intervals with distinct start and end points, and we want to find the maximum number of intervals overlapping some point.

## Solution

Let's transform the problem by assigning start points the value $1$ and end points the value $-1$. Then, if we put the start and end points into an array and sort them, the problem becomes: "given an array of values, find the maximum sum at some prefix in the array." This can be done by looping over the array and storing a running sum.

<Warning>

Make sure to not store the values in an `array`, as the maximum value can be up to $10^9$, and instead use something like a `vector`. 

</Warning>

## Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define rsz resize
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

int main(){
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int n; cin >> n;
    vector<pi> vals;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int l, r; 
        cin >> l >> r;
        vals.pb(mp(l, 1));
        vals.pb(mp(r, -1));
    }

    sort(all(vals)); 

    int sum = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    for (auto x : vals) {
        sum += x.s;
        ans = max(ans, sum);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
}
```
