[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_taming_gold_feb18.html)

This solution is $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ which is faster than the official editorial's but not required since $N \leq 100$.

## Explanation

Let $\texttt{dp}[i][j]$ be the the minimum number of changes that must be made
to the first $j$ entries so that there are $i$ breakouts among the first $j$
entries.

There are three cases when we calculate the current value of $\texttt{dp}[i][j]$:

- If the log was tampered with and the cows would NOT breakout:

  - Compared to the previous day, the breakout number won't change. However, we need one
    more change of the log, so we transfer from $\texttt{dp}[i][j-1]$.
    $$
    \texttt{dp}[i][j]=\texttt{dp}[i][j-1]+1
    $$

- If the log was tampered with and the cows would breakout (Notice that $a[j] \neq 0$):

  - Compared to the previous day the breakout number increases by 1. We also
    need one more change of the log, so we transfer from $\texttt{dp}[i-1][j-1]$.
    $$
    \texttt{dp}[i][j]=\texttt{dp}[i-1][j-1]+1
    $$

- If the log was NOT tampered with:
  - Then the $i$-th breakout would be on the $(j-a[j])$-th day, so we transfer from
    $\texttt{dp}[i-1][j-a[j]-1]$.
    $$
    \texttt{dp}[i][j] = \texttt{dp}[i-1][j-a[j]-1]+\texttt{range\_ans}[j-a[j]][j]);
    $$

$$\texttt{range\_ans}[l][r]$$ represents the minimum cost to replace the range
$a[l]...a[r]$ with $0...(r-l)$.

Thus, our final DP relation is

$$
\texttt{dp}[i][j] = \min\begin{cases} \texttt{dp}[i][j-1]+1\\
\texttt{dp}[i-1][j-1]+1\\
\texttt{dp}[i-1][j-a[j]-1] + \texttt{range\_ans}[j-a[j]][j])
\end{cases}
$$

Note that if the indices are out of bounds, the value is not considered.

				dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], range_ans[j - entry[j]][j]);
			}
		}
	}

	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		cout << dp[i][n - 1] << endl;
	}
