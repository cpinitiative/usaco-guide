## Alternate Solution - DP
### Explanation

If we define $\texttt{dp}[i][j]$ as the minimum number of skip points needed to get to the $i$th boss on turn $j$ 
(our turn is zero), then our transitions would be:

$\texttt{dp}[i + 1][0] =\min(\texttt{dp}[i + 1][0], \texttt{dp}[i][1] + \texttt{hard}[i])$

$\texttt{dp}[i + 2][0] =\min(\texttt{dp}[i + 2][0], \texttt{dp}[i][1] + \texttt{hard}[i] + \texttt{hard}[i + 1])$

$\texttt{dp}[i + 1][1] =\min(\texttt{dp}[i + 1][1], \texttt{dp}[i][0])$

$\texttt{dp}[i + 2][1] =\min(\texttt{dp}[i + 2][1], \texttt{dp}[i][0])$

This is because from each state, either the previous move, or the previous two moves could have been from the other player.

So, the answer would be $\min(\texttt{dp}[N][0], \texttt{dp}[N][1])$.

### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;

	for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
		int n;
		cin >> n;

		vector<int> bosses(n);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			cin >> bosses[i];
		}

		/*
		 * dp[i][j] = the min amount of skip points 
		 * on turn i (your turn is 0), on the jth boss.
		 * (1e9 to prevent overflow)
		 */
		vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(n + 1, 1e9));

		/* 
		 * base case:
		 * your friend uses zero skip points before fighting any bosses.
		 */
		dp[1][0] = 0;

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			// the opposite player switches on the previous move.
			dp[0][i + 1] = min(dp[0][i + 1], dp[1][i] + bosses[i]);
			dp[1][i + 1] = min(dp[1][i + 1], dp[0][i]);

			// the opposite player switches from the previous two moves.
			if (i + 2 <= n) {
				dp[0][i + 2] = min(dp[0][i + 2], dp[1][i] + bosses[i] + bosses[i + 1]);
				dp[1][i + 2] = min(dp[1][i + 2], dp[0][i]);
			}
		}
		cout << min(dp[0][n], dp[1][n]) << endl;
	}
}
