We can prime factorize $N$ as $N = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$.
To achieve the maximum number of operations, for each prime $p_i$, we should
first choose $z = p_i^1$, then $z = p_i^2$ and so on.

As we prime factorize and find the exponent of each prime, we can decrement the
exponent by $1$, then $2$, and so on, as long as the exponent stays nonnegative.
Each time we decrement the exponent, we can add $1$ to the answer.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	long long n;
	cin >> n;
	int ans = 0;
	//prime factorize n
	for (long long p = 2; p * p <= n; p++)
	{
		int exponent = 0;
		while (n % p == 0)
		{
			exponent++;
			n /= p;
		}
		//decrement the exponent by i each time
		for (int i = 1; exponent - i >= 0; i++)
		{
			exponent -= i;
			ans++;
		}
	}
	if (n > 1)
	{
		ans++;
	}
	cout << ans << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```py
n = int(input())
ans = 0
# prime factorization for n
for p in range(2, int(n ** 0.5)):
	e = 0
	while n % p == 0:
		n /= p
		e += 1
	# here p^e divides n 
	i = 1
	# taking p^1 then p^2 and so on until e < i
	while e >= i:
		e -= i
		ans += 1
		i += 1
    
ans += n > 1  # if n > 1 then it is a prime factor with e = 1
print(ans)
