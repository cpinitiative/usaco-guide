## Explanation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$

This problem asks us to find the number that should be added to another number so that it is strictly greater than 2 other numbers. 
In other words, letting $a,b,c$ be the values of the $3$ given numbers and $n$ be the number that will be added, we get the following equation:

$$a+n=\max(b,c)+1$$

Solving this, we get $n=max(b,x)+1-a$. With this, we can calculate $n$ for each of $a$, $b$, and $c$. However, it is important to note that if $n<0$, then we should output $0$, since the value to add can't be negative.

## Implementation

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	for (int tc = 0; tc < t; tc++) {
		int a, b, c;
		cin >> a >> b >> c;
	
		/*
		 * Calculate the value which must be passed
		 * in order for that person to win the election.
		 * For example, max(b,c) gives the amount which
		 * needs to be surpassed by a in order to win.
		 */
		int maxa = max(b, c);
		int maxb = max(a, c);
		int maxc = max(a, b);

		cout << max(0, maxa + 1 - a) << " " << max(0, maxb + 1 - b) << " " << max(0, maxc + 1 - c) << endl;
	}
}
```
