In this problem, we are asked to find how many people are sick based on what
type of milk each person drank, when they drank it, and when a person got sick.
To solve this problem, we must find the types of milk that could (potentially)
make a person sick. To do this, we must check if a person drank milk type X
before they became sick. Therefore, we loop over every sick person and store the
possible milk types in a 2D array of integers. Then, we loop over all the
possible milk types for every sick person and check for commonalities. If there
is consistency in the possible milk types (every sick person), then we add that
to an array and consider it one of the possible types of milk that would make
someone sick. After this, we check how many people drank one of the possible
milk types (consistent with each sick person), and print the number of people
who were sick.
