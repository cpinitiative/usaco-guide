## Explanation

We can do a simple brute force to find out which milk could possibly be bad,
and then see how many people that milk could have infected in total.

Since FJ needs one medicine for each person who could possibly get sick,
we can just take the maximum possible number of infected people over all
milk types that could have possibly gone bad.

The main issue is checking if a milk could have been the one that went bad.
To resolve this, let's treat both a person drinking milk and a person getting sick
as a type of *event*.
Then, we can have a list of events sorted by time. The sample case in this format
would be as follows:

<center>

| Time | Person | Drink |
|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
|1|1|1|
|1|1|4|
|2|1|2|
|3|3|1|
|3|1|NA|
|4|1|3|
|5|2|1|
|7|2|2|
|8|2|NA|

</center>

With this list of events, we can then go through marking the
people that could have possibly gotten sick and checking each
event where a person got sick if they could have possibly gotten sick.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(M(D+N))$
