In this problem, we're given $n$ elements, each with a weight and a value. Then, we're asked the maximum sum of values we can get such that the sum of weights are $\leq W$, for some $w$.

On first glance, this seems like a direct application of Knapsack. If you don't know what that is, read the resources in the [DP](/gold/intro-dp) module.

## Odd Constraints

Looking at the constraints, $w \leq 10^9$, so knapsack doesn't directly work. If we try to store $\texttt{dp[first i coins][sum of weights]}$, we'll get memory limit exceeded. However, $v_i \leq 10^3$, which is also different from regular knapsack.

## Switching the States

To deal with these constraints, we'll need to store the sum of values in the $\texttt{dp}$ state, and compute the weight. Let's observe that it's optimal to achieve some sum of values using the minimum possible sum of weights.

With this observation, we'll define a different $\texttt{dp}$. Let $\texttt{dp[i][j]}$ equal the minimum weight needed to achieve the sum of values $j$ using the first $i$ coins.

We can compute the $\texttt{dp}$ array similarly to normal knapsack, except taking the minimum weight instead of the maximum value in the transitions.

## Retrieving the Answer

Some value $v$ is achievable if $\texttt{dp[n][v]} \leq w$. To find the answer, iterate over all values $v$, and print the maximum which is achievable.

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define rsz resize
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()
using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair
void setIO(string name = "") { // name is nonempty for USACO file I/O
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); // see Fast Input & Output
	if(sz(name)){
		freopen((name+".in").c_str(), "r", stdin); // see Input & Output
		freopen((name+".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
	}
}

ll dp[105][100005];

int main(){
	int n, w; cin >> n >> w;
	vi a(n), b(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
	}
	memset(dp, 0x3f3f3f, sizeof(dp)); //fill dp with a large value
	dp[0][0] = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j <= 100000; j++) {
			dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j]);
			if (j - b[i - 1] >= 0) {
				dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - b[i - 1]] + a[i - 1]);
			}
		}
	}
	int ans = -1;
	for (int i = 0; i <= 100000; i++) {
		if(dp[n][i] <= w){
			ans = i;
		}
	}
	cout << ans << '\n';
}
```
