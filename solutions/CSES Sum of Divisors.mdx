Our goal is to compute the summation $\sum_{i=1}^n\left\lfloor \frac{n}{i}\right\rfloor\cdot i$ in faster than $\Theta(n)$ time. 

<Spoiler title="Hint">

$n=10^{12}$ implies that the desired time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt n)$!

<Spoiler title="Solution">

The key observation is that there are only $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt n)$ distinct values of $q=\left\lfloor \frac{n}{i}\right\rfloor$. To show this, consider $i\in [1,\sqrt n]$ and $i\in [\sqrt n+1,n]$ separately.

So we can quickly process all terms in the summation with the same value of $q$. We start with $i=1$ and increase it until it reaches $n$. Note that the smallest $j$ such that $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{j}\right\rfloor<\left\lfloor \frac{n}{i}\right\rfloor$ is just $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{i}\right\rfloor}\right\rfloor+1$.

```cpp
int main() {
	ll n; re(n);
	int ans = 0;
	for (ll i = 1, j; i <= n; i = j) {
		ll q = n/i; j = n/q+1; 
		// process terms [i..j-1] of the summation
		// since they all have the same quotient q
		// now we add q*sum(i..j-1) to the answer
		ll x = j-i, y = i+j-1; // x*y/2 = sum(i..j-1)
		if (x%2 == 0) x /= 2;
		else y /= 2;
		x %= MOD, y %= MOD;
		ans = (ans+q%MOD*x%MOD*y%MOD)%MOD;
	}
	ps(ans);
}
```
