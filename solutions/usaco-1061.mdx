## Solution

Since $x, y \leq 10^9$, we can't simulate each time period. Instead, we should look for signs which allow two cows to intersect. 

One important observation is that cows can't move backwards, so the only way for two cows to collide is if $n[x] > e[x] $ and $n[y] < e[y]$. 

This ensures that the cows are positioned like this:

From here, we can track which cows will collide and how much grass they'll eat.


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

	if dir == 'N':
