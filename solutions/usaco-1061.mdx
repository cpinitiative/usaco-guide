## Solution

Since $x, y \leq 10^9$, we can't simulate each time period. Instead, try to identify when pairs of cows intersect. 

One important observation is that cows can't move backwards, so the only way for two cows to collide is if $n[x] > e[x] $ and $n[y] < e[y]$. 

This ensures that the cows are positioned like this:

Now we can sort cows by their static coordinates, which ensure that earlier collisions will execute first, and simulate those collisions.


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
