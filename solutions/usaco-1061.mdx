## Solution

Since $x, y \leq 10^9$, we can't simulate each time period. Instead, try to identify when pairs of cows intersect. 

One important observation is that cows can't move backwards, so the only way for two cows to collide is if $n[x] > e[x] $ and $n[y] < e[y]$. 

This ensures that the cows are positioned like this:

![](usaco-1061/intersection_example.png)

Now we can sort cows by their static coordinates, which ensures that earlier collisions will execute first (i.e., simulating left to right), and simulate those collisions.


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

		string dir;
		int x, y;
		cin >> dir >> x >> y;

		// we need to add i as well because we need to output them in order
		if (dir == "N") {
			n_cows.push_back({x, y, i});
		} else {
			e_cows.push_back({x, y, i});

	// sort north cows by x value
	sort(n_cows.begin(), n_cows.end());

<Info title="Ternary Operator">
	A ternary operator is like a condensed if/else statement. 
	If a logical expression inside the parantheses is true, 
	the operator "returns" the first value in a pair seperated by a colon. 
	Otherwise, it uses the second value. 
	The general structure is as follows:
	
	`foo = logic ?` [set `foo` to this value if `logic` evaluates to true] `:` [set `foo` to this value `logic` evaluates to false]
