## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(|\texttt{word}|)$

<PySection>

```python
# Take in the cowphabet and string as strings through standard Python input
cowphabet = input()
word = input()

# For any string, we always have to look through the cowphabet at least once.
num_times = 1

for i in range(len(word) - 1):
	# Check if next character in string appears before previous character
	if cowphabet.index(word[i + 1]) <= cowphabet.index(word[i]):
		num_times += 1

print(num_times)
```
