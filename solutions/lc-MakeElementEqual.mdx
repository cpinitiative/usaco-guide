title: Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

## Solution

Because the problem does not specify which value we have to make all elements, note that only the relative values of the elements matter. Thus, increasing $n - 1$ b elements by one is the same as decreasing a single element by one. Solving this simplified problem is a matter of finding the minimum value in the array and transforming all other elements to match it, requiring a total of $sum - n \cdot min$ where $sum$ is the sum of the array and $min$ is the minimum value.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

## Implementation

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	int minMoves(vector<int>& nums) {
		int sum = 0, nim = 1000000005;
		for (int x : nums) {
			sum += x;
			nim = min(nim, x);
		}
		return sum - nim * nums.size();
	}
};
```
