Let's consider a simpler problem: given a graph, find the shortest cycle that passes through node 1.

What does a cycle through node 1 look like? In any cycle through node 1, there exists two nodes $u$ and $v$ on that cycle such that there is a path from 1 to $u$ and 1 to $v$, and there is an edge between $u$ and $v$. The length of this cycle is $dist(1, u) + dist(1, v) + 1$.

One might now try to use BFS to find $dist(1, i)$ for each $i$ in $\mathcal{O}(N + M)$ time and then check for each edge $(u, v)$ whether $dist(1, u) + dist(1, v) + 1$ is minimal.

Of course, this means that we might count a "cycle" like $1 \rightarrow x \rightarrow u \rightarrow v \rightarrow x \rightarrow 1$. However, this doesn't matter for our original problem, since the shortest cycle will always be shorter than such a "cycle".

There's one problem with this approach though: if the edge $(u, v)$ is on the path from node 1 to node $v$, then $1 \rightarrow u \rightarrow v \rightarrow 1$ isn't a cycle! And this time, it does matter in our original problem!

Fortunately, there's a relatively simple fix.

Instead of first finding all $dist(1, i)$ and then checking for the minimum, do both at the same time during the BFS.

Now to prevent "backtracking", we only consider $dist(1, u) + dist(1, v) + 1$ as a minimum if we're currently at node $u$ and $dist(1, u) \leq dist(1, v)$.

This algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(N + M)$ time. Since $N$ and $M$ are so small, we can just apply this algorithm for all nodes instead of just node 1.

The final complexity of this solution is thus $\mathcal{O}(N(N + M))$.

```cpp
int n,m,dist[2501],ans=MOD;
vi adj[2501];

int main() {
	setIO(); re(n,m);
	F0R(i,m) {
		int a,b; re(a,b);
		adj[a].pb(b), adj[b].pb(a);
	}
	FOR(i,1,n+1) {
		FOR(j,1,n+1) dist[j] = MOD;
		queue<int> q; q.push(i); dist[i] = 0;
		while (sz(q)) {
			int x = q.front(); q.pop();
			trav(t,adj[x]) {
				if (dist[t] == MOD)
					dist[t] = dist[x]+1, q.push(t);
				else if (dist[t] >= dist[x])
					ckmin(ans,dist[t]+dist[x]+1);
			}
		}
	}
	ps(ans == MOD ? -1 : ans);
}
```

We can modify the algorithm above to return either the length of the shortest cycle or the length of the shortest cycle plus one in $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time. See [here](https://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi/6.890/lecture9.pdf#page=4) for details.

```cpp
int n,m,dist[2501],ans=MOD;
vi adj[2501];

int main() {
	setIO(); re(n,m);
	F0R(i,m) {
		int a,b; re(a,b);
		adj[a].pb(b), adj[b].pb(a);
	}
	FOR(i,1,n+1) {
		FOR(j,1,n+1) dist[j] = MOD;
		queue<int> q; q.push(i); dist[i] = 0;
		while (sz(q)) {
			int x = q.front(); q.pop();
			trav(t,adj[x]) {
				if (dist[t] == MOD)
					dist[t] = dist[x]+1, q.push(t);
				else if (dist[t] >= dist[x]) {
					ckmin(ans,dist[t]+dist[x]+1);
					goto DONE;
				}
			}
		}
		DONE:;
	}
	ps(ans == MOD ? -1 : ans);
}
```
