[Official Analysis (C++ and Java)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_measurement_bronze_dec17.html)

## Explanation

Since there are only $3$ cows and $N \leq 1000$, we can sort all of the entries
by date and update the selected cow's milk value for each entry.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$
