[Official Analysis (C++ and Java)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_measurement_bronze_dec17.html)

## Explanation

Since there are only $3$ cows and $N \leq 1000$, we can sort all of the entries by date and update the selected cow's milk value for each entry.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```py
import sys
sys.stdin = open('measurement.in', 'r')

n = int(input())
INIT_MILK = 7
logs = []
# Every cow starts off producing 7 gallons of milk each.
bessie, elsie, mildred = INIT_MILK, INIT_MILK, INIT_MILK

"""
Since all cows produce the same amount of milk,
they'll all be on the display at the beginning.
"""
display = {'b', 'e', 'm'}

"""
This will store the past display,
so we can judge whether FJ needs to change his display.
