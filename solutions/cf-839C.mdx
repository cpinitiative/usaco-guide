## Explanation

The first step is to calculate the length and probability of each possible path.
We can do this using DFS. We start of with a probability of 1, or 100%. Then,
for each node, we divide the current path's probability by the number of
possible next moves.

For example, if node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, the probability of
reaching node 2 is $1/2$, or $0.5$, and the probability of reaching node 3 is
also $0.5$. If node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5, the probability of reaching
node 4 is $0.5 / 2 = 0.25$ and the probability of reaching node 5 is also
$0.25$. Let's say that nodes 2, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes. The possible paths are
listed below:

- $1 \rightarrow 2$ : 0.5
- $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4$ : 0.25
- $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 5$ : 0.25

To calculate the expected length of the journey, we multiply each of the
probabilities with the corresponding path length. In the example above, the
expected length would be $1\cdot0.5 + 2\cdot0.25 + 2\cdot0.25 = 1.5$

In the code, for each node, we calculate the number of possible next moves by
looping through the node's neighbors and counting how many are unvisited. If
there are no such nodes, then the path has ended and we can add the length of
the path times the probability to the final answer. Otherwise, we divide the
probability (as described above) and continue the DFS.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n;
vector<vector<int>> adj;  // adjacency list
vector<bool> visited;  // stores which nodes have been visited

long double ans;

void dfs(int node, int current_length, double current_probability) {
    visited[node] = true;
    int possible_moves = 0;
    // count the number of cities we can move to
    for (int x : adj[node]) {
        if (!visited[x]) {
            possible_moves++;
        }
    }

    if (!possible_moves) {
        // if there are no cities to move to, the path has ended
        ans += current_length * current_probability;
    } else {
        // update the new probability by dividing it
        // by the number of possible cities
        double new_probability = current_probability / possible_moves;
        for (int x : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[x]) {
                dfs(x, current_length + 1, new_probability);
            }
        }
    }

    // so that this node can be part of other possible paths
    visited[node] = false;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    adj.resize(n + 1);
    visited.resize(n + 1);

    for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        adj[a].push_back(b);
        adj[b].push_back(a);
    }

    // the traversal starts with node 1, path length 0, and probability 100%.
    dfs(1, 0, 1);

    cout << setprecision(10) << ans << endl;
}
```
