## Explanation
In order to store sections of the string, we can make a suffix array $S$, such that:

$${S_i = s_n + 10*s_{n-1} +100*s_{n-2} + ... + {10^{n-i}} * s_{i}}$$

For example, if our string was $$1234$$ and the modulus was $$3$$ (instead of $$2019$$ for the sake of simplicity), the suffix array would be

$$[1234, 234, 34, 4, 0]$$

**Keep in mind, that an empty suffix with is also considered.**

This is useful because we can access any substring in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time through a range query. So if $${S_0} = 1234 $$ and $${S_3=4}$$, this means $${S_0}-{S_3} = 123 * {10^1}$$ or $$1230$$.

It also means that if both $${S_0}(mod$$ $$M)=$$ $${S_3}(mod$$ $$M)$$ (both suffixes have the same remainders), subtracting would lead to $${S_0}(mod$$ $$M)-$$ $${S_3}(mod$$ $$M)=0$$, meaning a substring that is divisible by $$2019$$.

So with $$1234$$, $${S_0-{S_3}=1234(mod}$$ $$3)-4(mod$$ $$3)=1-1=0$$. Because they substract to zero, it means the substring from index $$0$$ to $$2$$ leads to a number divisible by the modulus. (The substring is $$123$$ which is divisble by 3).

However, we would still need to go through every pair of possible suffixes $(i, j)$ which would be $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$.

Instead, **we do not need to know which suffix has a certain remainder, but rather how many suffixes have that certain remainder.**

To elaborate, we can take $${N \choose K}$$, and choose 2 numbers that are divisible by the same remainder of 2019, where $$N=$$ the amount of times a certain remainder occurs, and $$K=$$ 2 (because we are picking 2 indicies $$i$$ and $$j$$).

Therefore, our answer is the counts of all the remainders in an array from $$0...2018$$ and $${N \choose 2}$$.

So in our example with $$1234$$, our new array would look like this:

$$[2, 3, 0]$$

Where each index represents the count of a certain remainder.
* There are $$2$$ suffixes with a remainder of $$0$$ when dividing by $$3$$, $$[234, 0]$$
* There are $$3$$ suffixes with a remainder of $$1$$ when dividing by $$3$$, $$[1234, 34, 4]$$
* And there are no suffixes with a remainder of $$2$$

So, the sum of all of these numbers would be $${2 \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}=1+3=4$$

If $$N<K$$, it should be $$0$$, since there aren't enough suffixes that can make a pair.

A prefix array can be utilized as well, but a suffix array is easier to implement.

	// initializes array with initializer list

	int count[2019]{1};
	for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		// find the remainder of the current number mod 2019
		num = (num + pow * (s[i] - '0')) % 2019;
		// increment the count of this remainder
		count[num]++;
		pow = pow * 10 % 2019;

	for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {
		// there are nC2 ways to pair the numbers with the same remainder
		ans += (long long)count[i] * (count[i] - 1) / 2;
