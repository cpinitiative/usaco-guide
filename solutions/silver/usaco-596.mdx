[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_gates_silver_jan16.html)

<Warning>

The official solution stores the farm in a $2005 \times 2005$ boolean array with
the origin at $(1002, 1002)$, but this is not sufficient. Since each fence
segment is doubled, the maximum distance in each direction could be $2000$
units, causing an input such as $1000$ $\texttt{N}$s to go out of bounds. To not
go out of bounds, an array of size $4003 \times 4003$ should be used: $1$ unit
for the origin position, $2000$ units in each direction from the origin and $1$
more unit in each direction to ensure that the farm includes area beyond the
fence.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
void ff(int i, int j);

bool fence[4003][4003] = {false};
bool visited[4003][4003] = {false};
int maxx = 2001, minx = 2001, maxy = 2001, miny = 2001;
int main() {
	freopen("gates.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("gates.out", "w", stdout);
	int n;
	string path;
	cin >> n >> path;
	int x = 2001, y = 2001;
	map<char, pair<int, int>> dir{
	    {'N', {-1, 0}}, {'S', {1, 0}}, {'E', {0, 1}}, {'W', {0, -1}}};
	// mark fences, scaling so they are 2 units instead of 1
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		fence[x + dir[path[i]].first][y + dir[path[i]].second] = true;
		fence[x + 2 * dir[path[i]].first][y + 2 * dir[path[i]].second] = true;
		x += 2 * dir[path[i]].first;
		y += 2 * dir[path[i]].second;
		minx = min(minx, x);
		maxx = max(maxx, x);
		miny = min(miny, y);
		maxy = max(maxy, y);
	}
	// expand the farm to include area outside the fences
	minx--;
	maxx++;
	miny--;
	maxy++;
	int regions = 0;
	// floodfill the farm to find the number of regions the farm is broken into
	for (int i = minx; i <= maxx; i++) {
		for (int j = miny; j <= maxy; j++) {
			if (!visited[i][j] && !fence[i][j]) {
				ff(i, j);
				regions++;
			}
		}
	}
	// answer is regions - 1 because each gate decreases the number of regions
	// by 1
	cout << regions - 1 << endl;
	return 0;
}

void ff(int i, int j) {
	if (i < minx || i > maxx || j < miny || j > maxy || visited[i][j] ||
	    fence[i][j]) {
		return;
	}
	visited[i][j] = true;
	int x[] = {-1, 0, 0, 1}, y[] = {0, -1, 1, 0};
	for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) { ff(i + x[k], j + y[k]); }
}
```

## Alternate Faster Solution

It is possible to make the following 2 observations:

1. For each contiguous closed region, there must be 1 gate. In a minimum state, each region has exactly 1 gate. For example, if there are 2 regions, there must be 2 gates.
2. Each time FJ comes across a node he has visited along an edge he has not crossed in either direction, he creates exactly 1 new region. In other words, FJ creates exactly 1 new contiguous closed region if all of these conditions are met:
	* FJ walks along an edge from point $a$ to $b$
	* He did not walk from $a$ to $b$ in the past
	* He did not walk from $b$ to $a$ in the past
	* $b$ is a point he had already visited

Under these observations, we can use a set of visited edges and visited nodes, and keep track of the number of contiguous closed regions. This solution is about 10 times faster than flood filling due to $\log N$ lookup and insertion.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$
