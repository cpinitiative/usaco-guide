Define the number of teleportations starting from a planet as the
$\texttt{pathlength}$ of that planet. For each planet that hasn't been visited,
we want to find its $\texttt{pathlength}$. Call the planet we are performing
$\texttt{dfs}$ from the $\textit{start}$. As we perform $\texttt{dfs}$ from the
$\textit{start}$, keep track of the planets seen, in order, in the
$\texttt{path}$ queue and keep track of $\texttt{steps}$, the length of the path
(which is also the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the $\textit{start}$). When we reach
a planet that has already been visited (call this planet the $\textit{repeat}$),
add the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the $\textit{repeat}$ to the current
$\texttt{step}$ count because we would continue to visit all of the planets that
$\textit{repeat}$ would go on to visit.

Once we have $\texttt{path}$ and $\texttt{steps}$ we can calculate the
$\texttt{pathlength}$ of all the planets in this $\texttt{path}$. We know the
$\textit{repeat}$ will always be the planet at the end of the $\texttt{path}$,
but it may appear elsewhere as well. We can break this down into two cases:

1. The $\textit{repeat}$ was visited twice in the current $\texttt{path}$. The
   planets in the $\texttt{path}$ between the two occurrences of the
   $\textit{repeat}$ form a $\textit{cycle}$.
2. The $\textit{repeat}$ only appears at the end of the current $\texttt{path}$.
   All of the planets in the $\texttt{path}$ are not part of a $\textit{cycle}$.

For planets inside a $\textit{cycle}$, the repeating planet when starting from
that planet is itself. For all the planets in the $\texttt{path}$ but outside
the $\textit{cycle}$, the planet that repeats when starting from each planet
will still be the $\textit{repeat}$.

Since the planets outside the $\textit{cycle}$ all have paths ending at the
$\textit{repeat}$, each one's $\texttt{pathlength}$ is $1$ less than the
previous'. So, as we iterate through the planets along the $\texttt{path}$ that
are outside the $\textit{cycle}$, the $\texttt{pathlength}$ will decrease by $1$
each time, starting from the $\textit{start}$ with a $\texttt{pathlength}$ of
$\texttt{steps}$. Once we get to the $\textit{cycle}$, the $\texttt{pathlength}$
of the planets will all be equal to the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the
$\textit{repeat}$, which is the length of the $\textit{cycle}$.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
void dfs(int planet);

bool visited[200000]{};
int destinations[200000];
int pathlength[200000]{};
queue<int> path;
int steps = 0;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> destinations[i];
		destinations[i]--;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if (!visited[i]) {
			steps = 0;
			dfs(i);
			int decrement = 1;
			// for each planet in current path, calculate pathlength
			while (!path.empty()) {
				// we are in the cycle; all nodes have same pathlength
				if (path.front() == path.back()) { decrement = 0; }
				pathlength[path.front()] = steps;
				steps -= decrement;
				path.pop();
			}
		}
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cout << pathlength[i] << " "; }
	cout << endl;
	return 0;
}

void dfs(int planet) {
	// add planet to path
	path.push(planet);
	if (visited[planet]) {
		// add pathlength of the repeat planet to current step count
		steps += pathlength[planet];
		return;
	}
	visited[planet] = true;
	steps++;
	dfs(destinations[planet]);
