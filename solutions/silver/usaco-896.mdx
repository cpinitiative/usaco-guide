## Explanation

Notice that a mountain is obscured by another mountain iff the base of the mountain (the area the mountain takes up on the ground) is contained within the base of the other mountain.

However, going through all pairs of mountains and checking if one is obscured by another takes $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time and is too slow given the input size.

To speed things up, let's sort the mountains by their left end first and then iterate through all of them, keeping track of the rightmost right end we've seen.
Then, if the right side of the current mountain is less than the current highest right end, we know that that mountain is obscured by another.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Mountain {
	int start, end;
};

bool operator<(const Mountain &m1, const Mountain &m2) {
	// sort by start and tiebreak by putting the larger mountains first
	if (m1.start == m2.start) { return m1.end > m2.end; }
	return m1.start < m2.start;
}

int main() {
	std::ifstream read("mountains.in");
	int mountain_num;
	read >> mountain_num;

	vector<Mountain> mountains;
	for (int m = 0; m < mountain_num; m++) {
		int x, y;
		read >> x >> y;
		// store the mountains by the interval they cover
		mountains.push_back({x - y, x + y});
	}
	sort(mountains.begin(), mountains.end());

	int rightmost = -1;
	int visible_num = 0;
	for (const Mountain &m : mountains) {
		if (m.end > rightmost) {
			visible_num++;
			rightmost = m.end;
		}
	}

	std::ofstream("mountains.out") << visible_num << endl;
}
