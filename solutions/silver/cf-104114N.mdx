## Explanation

The goal is to balance the salt levels on $ n $ slices of steak so that the difference between adjacent slices doesn't exceed $ m $. We can't remove any salt ($ s'_i \geq s_i $), and we want to add as little extra salt as possible. The key to solving this lies in understanding how to smooth out the salt distribution step by step.

Think of it this way:

1. Moving forward (left-to-right), no slice has too little salt compared to the one before it. Specifically, each slice should have at least as much salt as the previous slice minus $ m $. This prevents sharp drops in flavor.
2. Moving backward (right-to-left), no slice has too much salt compared to the next one. Each slice shouldnt exceed the salt level of the next slice plus $ m $. This avoids sudden spikes when looking backward.

To achieve this, we break the problem into two steps:
- First, we move left-to-right, ensuring each slice meets the minimum requirement based on the slice before it. This step focuses on preventing bland spots.
- Then, we move right-to-left, smoothing out any excess salt to ensure no slice feels overly salty compared to the next. This step refines the distribution for balance.


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
	int n, m;
	std::cin >> n >> m;
	std::vector<int> arr(n);
	for (int &x : arr) { std::cin >> x; }

	int running_max = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		running_max = std::max(arr[i], running_max - m);
		arr[i] = running_max;
	}

	running_max = 0;
	for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		running_max = std::max(running_max - m, arr[i]);
		arr[i] = running_max;
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { std::cout << arr[i] << " \n"[i == n - 1]; }
}
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
n, m = map(int, input().split())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

running_max = 0
for i in range(n):
	running_max = max(arr[i], running_max - m)
	arr[i] = running_max

running_max = 0
for i in reversed(range(n)):
	running_max = max(arr[i], running_max - m)
	arr[i] = running_max

print(*arr)
```
