We can use a greedy approach to solve this problem. First, sort the applicants
and apartments. We can keep two pointers $i$ and $j$ (initialized to 0),
which keep track of the current index of the applicant and apartment we are
looking at respectively. Then, while there are more applicants and apartments to
look through, we repeatedly run the following check:

- If $|\texttt{applicants}[i] - \texttt{apartments}[j]| \leq k$, we have found a
  suitable apartment for the current applicant. Thus, we increment $i$, $j$, and
  our answer.
- Otherwise, $\texttt{apartments}[j]$ is either too big or too small for
  $\texttt{applicants}[i]$. We can increment $i$ or $j$ accordingly.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n)+m\log(m))$

			++ans;
		}
		else{
			// If the desired apartment size of the applicant is too big,
			// move the apartment pointer to the right to find a bigger one
			if (a[i] - b[j] > k){
				++j;
			}
			// If the desired apartment size is too small,
			// skip that applicant and move to the next person
			else{
				++i;
			}
		}

	cout << ans << "\n";
