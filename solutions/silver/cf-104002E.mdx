## Explanation

First note that the only requirement for a valid solution is that for any even number $k \leq n$, William must have selected at most $\frac{k}{2}$ integers out of the first $k$ integers.
It is impossible to select more than $\frac{k}{2}$ integers in the first $k$ integers, since the robot will have taken all other $\frac{k}{2}$ integers by the time you can choose your next integer.
Note that it is also possible to "save" your choices, since you can choose less than $\frac{k}{2}$ integers for $k < n$, allowing you to choose more for a larger $k$.

For example, if we had array of size $4$, we could select either of the first two elements and either of the last two elements, selecting exactly $\frac{k}{2}$ integers for both $k = 2$ and $k = 4$.
Alternatively, we could select both of the last two elements, selecting 0 integers for $k = 2$ and $2$ integers for $k = 4$.
Note that we cannot take both the first and second element, since the Robot will take the one we don't pick.

To solve this problem, we can iterate $k$ from $1$ to $n$ and maintain a priority queue of the numbers tentatively selected by William so far. For each $k$ we push $a_k$ to the priority queue, and then if $k$ is even, pop the smallest element of the priority queue while the number of taken integers is greater than $k/2$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	vector<int> a(n);
	for (int &i : a) { cin >> i; }

	// stores currently selected numbers
	priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> taken;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		taken.push(a[i]);
		if (i & 1) taken.pop();
	}

	long long ans = 0;
	while (!taken.empty()) {
		ans += taken.top();
		taken.pop();
	}

	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

```java

import java.util.*;

public class WilliamAndRobot {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();

		int n = io.nextInt();
		int[] a = new int[n];

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { a[i] = io.nextInt(); }

		PriorityQueue<Integer> taken = new PriorityQueue<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			taken.offer(a[i]);
			if (i % 2 == 1) { taken.poll(); }
		}

		long ans = 0;
		while (!taken.isEmpty()) { ans += taken.poll(); }

		io.println(ans);
		io.close();
	}

	// CodeSnip{Kattio}
}

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

taken = []
for i in range(n):
	heapq.heappush(taken, a[i])
	if i % 2 == 1:
		heapq.heappop(taken)
