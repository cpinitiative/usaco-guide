[Official Analysis (C++)](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/8192)

## Explanation

Since we don't necessarily have to defeat all of Jiro's cards, there are two routes we can take:
1. Focus on getting the maximum amount of damage without defeating all of Jiro's cards.
2. Focus on defeating all of Jiro's cards and then deal direct damage.

We'll solve for each section independently.

In the first approach, note that since we're not looking towards defeating all of the cards, we gain **nothing** from attacking Jiro's defense cards. Thus, we'll pair up Jiro's weakest attack cards against our strongest attack cards.

In the second approach, to make sure that we don't lose any attack damage, we'll pair up Jiro's cards with the **smallest** card greater than it.

At the end, we'll return the larger quantity.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NM)$

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using std::endl;
using std::string;
using std::vector;

struct Card {
	// 1 -> ATK | 0 -> DEF
	bool type;
	int strength;
};

int main() {
	int n, m;
	std::cin >> n >> m;

	vector<Card> jiro;
	vector<Card> ciel;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		string type;
		int strength;
		std::cin >> type >> strength;

		jiro.push_back({type == "ATK", strength});
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int strength;
		std::cin >> strength;

		ciel.push_back({1, strength});
	}

	// first case: only hit ATK + assign weak cards with strong cards

	// sort by type and then by strength
	std::sort(jiro.begin(), jiro.end(), [](const Card &a, const Card &b) {
		if (a.type == b.type) { return a.strength < b.strength; }
		return a.type > b.type;
	});

	std::sort(ciel.begin(), ciel.end(), [](const Card &a, const Card &b) {
		return a.strength > b.strength;
	});

	int appr1 = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < std::min(n, m); i++) {
		// break if either we're attacking DEF cards or we don't gain anything
		if (!jiro[i].type || ciel[i].strength <= jiro[i].strength) { break; }

		appr1 += ciel[i].strength - jiro[i].strength;
	}

	std::reverse(jiro.begin(), jiro.end());
	std::reverse(ciel.begin(), ciel.end());

	vector<bool> done(m);

	int appr2 = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		bool fnd = false;

		for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
			// if we haven't used j and this card can beat Jiro's card
			if (!done[j] &&
			    ((jiro[i].type && ciel[j].strength >= jiro[i].strength) ||
			     (!jiro[i].type && ciel[j].strength > jiro[i].strength))) {
				done[j] = true;

				if (jiro[i].type) {
					appr2 += ciel[j].strength - jiro[i].strength;
				}

				fnd = true;
				break;
			}
		}

		// if we can't do any direct damage, output the first approach
		if (!fnd) {
			std::cout << appr1 << endl;
			return 0;
		}
	}

	// add up all of the direct damage done
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		if (!done[i]) { appr2 += ciel[i].strength; }
	}

	std::cout << std::max(appr2, appr1) << endl;
}
