## Solution 2 - Two Pointers

For each city, we need to find the minimum distance to a tower, which we will call pairing. Observe that if a tower $T$'s position is greater a city $C$'s position, then all towers with a coordinate greater that of $T$ cannot pair to provide the minimum distance with $C$. Furthermore, if a city $C_1$ has a position less than $C_2$, then any towers with a position less than that of $C_1$'s tower cannot provide the minimum distance for $C_2$. These two details allow us to use two pointers to solve this problem.

We store two pointers, one for the current city and one for the current tower. We start at the first city and first tower, both with the smallest coordinate. We calculate the distance between the city and towers with increasingly higher coordinates until the current tower's coordinate is greater than that of the current city. One of these distances must be the minimum distance from the city to all towers. Then, we start the process for the next city and keep the pointer at the current tower. We repeat this process for all cities in order of their position. The maximum out of all the minimum distances between a city and a tower will be our answer.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

## Solution 3 - Using a Set

We use the set $\texttt{towers}$ to store the coordinates of the cellular
towers. For each city, we want to find the closest tower and calculate the
distance. The minimal $r$ will be the maximum of all these distances. To find
the closest tower to a certain city, we check the towers to the left and right
and determine which one is closer.

For each city, we use
[`lower_bound`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/lower_bound/) to
find the closest tower to the right of the city. If this tower is found,
calculate the distance between this tower and the city. If the tower is not at
the beginning of the set, the previous tower in the set will be the tower to the
left of the city. Define $\texttt{dist}$ to be the minimum of the distance to
the tower on the right and the distance to the tower on the left. Then, set $r$
to be the maximum of itself and $\texttt{dist}$.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$
