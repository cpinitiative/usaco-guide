[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_milkvisits_silver_dec19.html)

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N + M)$

We perform a search on the tree, identifying connected components of cows that
all have the same breed.

In the sample test case, there are $3$ connected components:

- Component $0$: Farms $1$, $2$, and $4$
- Component $1$: Farm $3$
- Component $2$: Farm $5$

Next, we assign the farms in each component a number corresponding to the component
they are in.
For example, in the sample test case, farm $1$ would get the number $0$, $3$ would get
the number $1$, and so on and so forth.

When checking if a visiting farmer going from farm $A$ to $B$ will be happy,
there's two possible cases:

1. Farms $A$ and $B$ are part of the same component. This means the path between
   $A$ and $B$ only contains cows of the same breed. If the farmer prefers milk
   from this breed, then we should output $1$ and $0$ otherwise.
2. Farms $A$ and $B$ are part of different components. This means that the
   farmer will always be satisfied because the path between $A$ and $B$ contains
   both breeds of cows, and so we should always output $1$.

Here's a walkthrough for the sample test case queries:

1. Farms $1$ and $4$ are in the same component, and since Farmer $1$'s preferred
   cow is Holstein, they will be satisfied. ($1$)
2. Farms $1$ and $4$ are in the same component, but since Farmer $2$'s preferred
   cow is Guernsey, they will be unsatisfied. ($0$)
3. Farms $1$ and $3$ are in different components, so Farmer $3$ will be
   satisfied. ($1$)
4. Same logic as query $3$. ($1$)
5. Farm $5$ is Guernsey, and Farmer $5$'s preferred cow is Holstein, they will
   be unsatisfied. ($0$)
