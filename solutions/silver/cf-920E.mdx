## Solution 1 - Faster DFS

Doing a standard DFS would be too slow. There can be at most $\frac{N(N-1)}2$ edges, which would result in $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time complexity. To speed it up, we have to do two optimizations.

### Optimization 1

We can store whether edges are non-existent using an array of hashsets instead of an adjacency list. This way we can find if there is no edge between two nodes in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. Using an adjacency matrix would take too much
memory.

### Optimization 2

Rather than using a standard boolean array to check if a node has not yet been visited, we can use a set of unvisited nodes. This way we only loop through the nodes that have not been visited yet and can find the next unvisited node in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$. We need to use ```upper_bound``` to find
the next unvisited node after a DFS - an iterator may be invalidated due to the
node it is pointing to being destroyed when we remove it from the unvisited set.

### Proof

We know that a node can either be skipped or visited. We also know that once a
node is visited, it cannot be revisited. Therefore we will always visit $N$ nodes once. We also know that the sum of skips can be at most $2M$ (each
non-edge skips two nodes). Therefore the overall complexity will be
$O(N\log N+M)$.

## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N+M)$

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 200000;
unordered_set<int> adj[MAX_N];
set<int> unvis;  // the set of nodes that have not been visited
int sz[MAX_N];   // sz[i] = size of the ith connected component
int cur = 0;     // current amount of groups
void dfs(int x) {
	sz[cur]++;
	auto it = unvis.begin();
	while (it != unvis.end()) {
		// if there is no edge between x and *it, skip
		if (adj[x].count(*it)) {
			it++;
		} else {
			// there is a edge between last and x
			int last = *it;
			// note it = unvis.erase(it) doesn't work here because it could be
			// erased later
			unvis.erase(it);
			dfs(last);
			// find the node after last
			it = unvis.upper_bound(last);
		}
	}
}
int main() {
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int a, b;
		cin >> a >> b;
		a--;
		b--;
		adj[a].insert(b);
		adj[b].insert(a);
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { unvis.insert(i); }
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		auto it = unvis.find(i);
		if (it != unvis.end()) {
			unvis.erase(it);
			dfs(i);
			cur++;
		}
	}
	cout << cur << endl;
	sort(sz, sz + cur);
	for (int i = 0; i < cur; i++) { cout << sz[i] << ' '; }
	cout << endl;
}

## Solution 2 - Selective DFS

Let $N =$ the number of nodes in the graph, $n =$ an arbitrary node, and $\texttt{degree}(n)=$ the number of neighboring nodes (nodes that are directly connected to $n$).


We know that the size of the component containing node $n$ must be at least
$\texttt{degree}(n)+1$ ($\texttt{degree}(n)$ doesn't include $n$).

If $\texttt{degree}(n_1)+1>\dfrac{N}2$ and $\texttt{degree}(n_2)+1>\dfrac{N}2$,
$n_1$ and $n_2$ must intersect, otherwise the graph must have more than $N$ nodes.

Given this, we can just put all nodes with $\texttt{degree} +1 > \dfrac{N}2$
into the same group in $O(N)$ time.

Now we can just process all nodes with $\texttt{degree}+1\le\dfrac{N}2$, with DFS.

### Proof

We can handle all nodes with $\texttt{degree}+1>\dfrac{N}2$ in $O(N)$ time.

Let there be $N'$ nodes that have at most $\dfrac{N}2 -1 â‰ˆ \dfrac{N}2$ edges. Then, they also must have at least $\dfrac{N}2$ non-edges. Therefore, there must be at least $\dfrac{N'\cdot\dfrac{N}2}2 = \dfrac{N\cdot N'}4$ non-edges (each edge accounts for two nodes).

The input states that the number of edges is less than $2 \cdot 10^5$, therefore $\dfrac{N \cdot N'}4\le2\cdot10^5$, therefore $N \cdot N' \le8\cdot10^5$.

Doing a simple DFS and checking whether two nodes intersect would be $\mathcal{O}(NN'+ \log M)$, which would fit under the time limit. The $\log M$ comes from processing input. Therefore, this runs under the time limit.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NN'+ \log M)$
