<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

Is there any reason for Farmer John to milk a cow that produces less milk over a cow that produces more?
On a similar note, is there any reason for him to rent a cow that produces more milk over a cow that produces less milk?

<Spoiler title="Answer to Hint 1">

There isn't! It's *always* optimal to milk the cow that produces the most milk or rent the cow that produces the least milk.

[Official Analysis (Java)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_rental_silver_jan18.html)

## Explanation

Notice that we should always compare the highest-producing cow and the store offering the most money with the farmer offering the most money.

To do this, we can make 3 lists containing the stores, farmers, and cows.
Then, we sort the stores and farmers by the prices offered, and sort the cows by their milk production.

Then, when we go through the list, we'll either milk the highest-producing cow or rent the lowest-producing cow, whichever one is more lucrative.

## Implementation

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("rental.in", "r", stdin);
	int n, m, r;
	cin >> n >> m >> r;

	vector<int> milk_amt(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> milk_amt[i]; }

	vector<pair<int, int>> shops(m);
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { cin >> shops[i].second >> shops[i].first; }

	vector<int> rent(r);
	for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) { cin >> rent[i]; }

	// sort cows by milk production in descending order
	sort(milk_amt.begin(), milk_amt.end(), greater<int>());
	// sort shops by selling price in descending order
	sort(shops.begin(), shops.end(), greater<pair<int, int>>());
	// sort rent in descending order
	sort(rent.begin(), rent.end(), greater<int>());

	int shop_at = 0;  // the index of the shop which we've bought up to
	int rent_at = 0;  // the index of the farmer we've rented up to
	int cow_at = 0;
	long long max_money = 0;
	while (cow_at < n) {
		int amt = milk_amt[cow_at];
		int sold_money = 0;  // how much we can make from selling the milk
		int curr_shop = shop_at;
		int last = 0;

		// calculate how much money this cow can make if we sell its milk
		while (curr_shop < m) {
			int sold = min(amt, shops[curr_shop].second);
			sold_money += shops[curr_shop].first * sold;
			amt -= sold;

			if (amt == 0) {
				last = sold;
				break;
			} else {
				curr_shop++;
			}
		}

		// should we rent or sell this cow?
		if (rent_at >= r || sold_money > rent[rent_at]) {
			max_money += sold_money;
			shop_at = curr_shop;
			if (shop_at < m) { shops[shop_at].second -= last; }
			cow_at++;
		} else {
			max_money += rent[rent_at];
			/*
			 * instead of renting this cow, it's better to rent off
			 * the cow that makes the least amount of milk
			 * (we don't process the cow at the end of the list)
			 */
			n--;
			rent_at++;
		}
	}

	freopen("rental.out", "w", stdout);
	cout << max_money << endl;
