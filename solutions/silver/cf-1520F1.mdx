## Explanation

To efficiently locate the $k$-th zero within a segment $[l, r]$, we utilize a binary search strategy. Initially, our segment encompasses the entire range $[l, r]$. The objective is to gradually narrow down this segment until we pinpoint the exact position of the $k$-th zero.

We start by defining the midpoint of the current segment as $m = \frac{l+r}{2}$. This allows us to divide the segment into two halves: $[l, m]$ and $[m+1, r]$.

Next, we perform a query to determine the number of zeros within the left half $[l, m]$. Let's denote this count as $x$. Based on the result:
- If $x$ is greater than or equal to $k$, it indicates that at least $k$ zeros lie within the left half $[l, m]$. Therefore, we focus our search on this left segment $[l, m]$ to find the $k$-th zero.
- If $x$ is less than k, then the $k$-th zero must lie in the right segment $[m+1, r]$. In this case, we adjust $k$ to $(k - x)$ and continue our search in the right segment $[m+1, r]$.

By following this iterative strategy, we continuously refine our search segment based on whether the $k$-th zero is expected to be in the left or right half. This systematic approach allows us to gradually narrow down the range $[l, r]$ until we pinpoint the exact position of the $k$-th zero.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int f(int r, int k) {
	int res;
	cout << "? " << 1 << " " << r << '\n';
	cin >> res;
	return r - res <= k;
}

int main() {
	int n, t, k;
	cin >> n >> t >> k;
	k--;

	int lo = 0;
	int hi = n;
	while (hi - lo > 1) {
		int mid = (lo + hi) >> 1;
		if (f(mid, k)) {
			lo = mid;
		} else {
			hi = mid;
		}
	}

	cout << "! " << hi << '\n';
}
```

```py
def f(r: int, k: int) -> bool:
	print(f"? 1 {r}")
	res = int(input())
	return r - res <= k


n, t = map(int, input().split())
k = int(input()) - 1

lo = 0
hi = n
while hi - lo > 1:
	mid = (lo + hi) // 2
	if f(mid, k):
		lo = mid
	else:
		hi = mid

print(f"! {hi}")
```
