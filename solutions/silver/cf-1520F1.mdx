## Implementation
To efficiently locate the $k$-th zero within a segment $[l, r]$, we utilize a binary search strategy. Initially, our segment encompasses the entire range $[l, r]$. The objective is to gradually narrow down this segment until we pinpoint the exact position of the $k$-th zero.

We start by defining the midpoint of the current segment as $m = \frac{l+r}{2}$. This allows us to divide the segment into two halves: $[l, m]$ and $[m+1, r]$.

Next, we perform a query to determine the number of zeros within the left half $[l, m]$. Let's denote this count as $x$. Based on the result:
- If $x$ is greater than or equal to $k$, it indicates that at least $k$ zeros lie within the left half $[l, m]$. Therefore, we focus our search on this left segment $[l, m]$ to find the $k$-th zero.
- If $x$ is less than k, then the $k$-th zero must lie in the right segment $[m+1, r]$. In this case, we adjust $k$ to $(k - x)$ and continue our search in the right segment $[m+1, r]$.

By following this iterative strategy, we continuously refine our search segment based on whether the $k$-th zero is expected to be in the left or right half. This systematic approach allows us to gradually narrow down the range $[l, r]$ until we pinpoint the exact position of the $k$-th zero.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$
