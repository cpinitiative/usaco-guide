<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

The upper bound for the number of bridges we can have is $n - 1$ because
each bridge is present in any [spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) of the graph.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Let's consider allocating a certain amount of these nodes to forming a tree.
How can we use the rest of these nodes to use as many edges as possible?

<Spoiler title="Explanation">

The most bridges we can have in a graph with $n$ nodes is $n - 1$ bridges.
As a result, our answer is in the range $[n - 1, 2n - 2]$.

Let's consider binary
searching on our answer. If we have $x$ edges that we need to use, then
$\lfloor \frac{x + 1}{2} \rfloor$ of these edges must be bridges.

Recall that the best way to create bridges is to create a tree. Thus, we use all of these
bridge edges to form a tree, and then use the one extra edge to connect this tree
to some component of nodes. Note that this extra edge is also a bridge. With the rest of our nodes, we can form a complete
graph of nodes to use as many edges as possible.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(Q\log{N})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	int test_num;
	cin >> test_num;
	for (int i = 0; i < test_num; i++) {
		int nodes;
		cin >> nodes;

		ll low = nodes - 1;
		ll high = 2ll * (nodes - 1);
		while (low < high) {
			ll mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
			int num_bridges = (mid + 1) / 2;
			int cycle_nodes = nodes - num_bridges;
			ll cycle_edges = 1ll * cycle_nodes * (cycle_nodes - 1) / 2;

			if (mid - num_bridges <= cycle_edges) {
				low = mid;
			} else {
				high = mid - 1;
			}
		}

		cout << low << '\n';
	}
}
```

		for (int t = 0; t < testNum; t++) {
			int nodes = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

			long low = nodes - 1;
			long high = 2L * (nodes - 1);
			while (low < high) {
				long mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
				long num_bridges = (mid + 1) / 2;
				long cycle_nodes = nodes - num_bridges;
				long cycle_edges = cycle_nodes * (cycle_nodes - 1) / 2;

				if (mid - num_bridges <= cycle_edges) {
					low = mid;
				} else {
					high = mid - 1;
				}
			}

			System.out.println(low);
