title: Even Outdegree Edges

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N)$.

Without loss of generality, assume that the number of edges is even and there's
only one connected component in the graph.

Consider the following simpler problem: given a rooted tree, direct the edges so
that all nodes except for the root have an even out-degree; the root's degree
may be of any parity.

We can solve this simpler problem recursively through a DFS. Imagine that we're
processing some subtree rooted at node $v$. First, process each of $v$'s
children's subtrees **but don't direct $v$'s incident edges yet**. Although the
children's out-degree parity may be arbitrary after this, we can then direct
each of $v$'s incident edges to make them all even. This solution works in
$\mathcal O(N)$ time.

It turns out that this also solves the version of the problem where the root of
the tree must also have even out-degree! This is because the sum of out-degrees
is equal to the number of edges - since the out-degrees of all nodes besides the
root are even, the out-degree of the root must also be even.

To generalize this solution to an arbitrary graph, we simply:

1. Find the DFS tree (which will be a spanning tree).
2. Direct all edges that aren't part of this tree "upwards".
3. Run the solution for a tree on the DFS tree (except some nodes must have
   **odd** out-degree now).

Step 2 works because of the fact that all edges that aren't part of the DFS tree
are **back-edges** (i.e. edges where one node is a parent of the other). For
more information about the DFS tree, read

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> graph[100001];
int visited[100001], odd[100001], timer = 1;
vector<pair<int, int>> ans;

void dfs(int node, int parent = 0) {
	visited[node] = timer++;
	for (int i : graph[node])
		if (i != parent) {
			if (!visited[i]) {
				dfs(i, node);
				if (odd[i]) {
					ans.push_back({i, node});
					odd[i] = 0;
				} else {
					ans.push_back({node, i});
					odd[node] ^= 1;
				}
			} else if (visited[node] > visited[i]) {
				ans.push_back({node, i});
				odd[node] ^= 1;
			}
		}
}

int main() {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
	int n, m;
	scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
	while (m--) {
		int u, v;
		scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
		graph[u].push_back(v);
		graph[v].push_back(u);
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		if (!visited[i]) dfs(i);
	if (accumulate(odd + 1, odd + n + 1, 0)) printf("IMPOSSIBLE");
	else
		for (pair<int, int> i : ans) printf("%d %d\n", i.first, i.second);
	return 0;
}
