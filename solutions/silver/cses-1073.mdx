Greedy approach: always add the next cube on top of the tower with the smallest
possible cube on top (or create a new tower if this isn't possible).

Equivalent to longest non-decreasing subsequence!

It's important to note that we cannot use brute force to find the tower with the
smallest possible cube on top because that will yield a time complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, which is too slow.

## Solution 1 - Binary Search + Dynamic Array

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$

We can store existing towers using a dynamic array, where each tower's value is
the size of the cube on top. For each cube, we can run upper bound binary search
on the array to find the tower with the smallest top cube that's strictly larger
than the current cube. If we find a suitable tower, we add the cube to the top
and change the tower's value to the size of the cube. If no such tower exists,
append a new tower to the end of the array. By doing so, we maintain the tower
array in a sorted order (try and prove this for yourself). Our answer will be
the size of the array after all cubes have been processed.

## Solution 2 - Multiset

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$

In this approach, we store the towers using an ordered multiset (which can be
represented as a
[TreeMap](/silver/intro-sorted-sets?lang=java#multisets) in
Java), where each tower's value is the size of the cube on top. For each cube,
we can use built-in methods (`upper_bound` in C++, `higherKey` in Java) to find
the smallest-valued tower with a value strictly greater than the cube. If we
find a suitable tower, we add the cube to the top and change the tower's value
to the size of the cube by removing the tower's previous value from the set and
adding it's new value into it. If no such tower exists, we add a new tower to
the set. Our answer will be the total number of towers in the multiset (this
takes some extra work to find in Java) after all cubes have been processed.

	multiset<int> ans;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		cin >> k;
		auto it = ans.upper_bound(k);
		// Find the tower having the element that is just larger than k to add
		// k to. If it doesn't exist then we create a new tower.
		if (it == ans.end()) ans.insert(k);
		else {
			// If there exists a satisfying tower, add k to that tower and
			// update the top element of the tower
			ans.erase(it);
			ans.insert(k);
