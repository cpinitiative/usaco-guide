[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_prob1_silver_feb22.html)

## Solution 1

See the official analysis.

## Solution 2 - Strongly Connected Components

## Explanation

Similar to the official analysis, we can construct a directed edge from $i$ to $j$ if cow $i$ prefers gift $j$ to gift $i$.
If cow $i$ is able to receive a gift where it has an outgoing edge, then cow $i$ has received the most optimal gift it can be reassigned.
Remember to also add an edge from cow $i$ to itself in case it cannot get a better gift.

Then, we can separate the graph into strongly connected components (SCCs). If $i$ is in an SCC, this means that cow $i$ can receive
all gifts in the SCC through a series of reassignments by definition of an SCC. The SCC must also have at least one of cow $i$'s preferred gift
because it must contain at least one outgoing edge from $i$. If a cow does not belong in an SCC, it cannot receive a more optimal reassignment.

## Implementation

[Kosaraju's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju's_algorithm) can be used to find all SCCs in the graph. At the end, it is optimal to just go down cow $i$'s preference list and assign the first gift belonging in the SCC.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
const int N = 501;

// The adjacency lists for the graph (revgraph is reversed)
vector<int> graph[N], revgraph[N];
vector<bool> vis(N), vis2(N);
vector<int> path;

// Stores all nodes in a SCC
set<int> comp;

// DFS functions for Kosaraju's
void dfs(int node) {
	vis[node] = true;
	for (int i : graph[node]) {
		if (!vis[i]) { dfs(i); }
	}
	path.push_back(node);
}

void dfs2(int node) {
	vis2[node] = true;
	for (int i : revgraph[node]) {
		if (!vis2[i]) { dfs2(i); }
	}
	comp.insert(node);
}

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		// The graph array contains the cow i's preferred gifts (and itself).
		graph[i].resize(n);
		for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { cin >> graph[i][j]; }
		/*
		 * We don't want edges to non-preferred gifts,
		 * so we remove all gifts after its original assignment.
		 */
		while (graph[i].back() != i) { graph[i].pop_back(); }
		for (int j : graph[i]) { revgraph[j].push_back(i); }
	}

	// classic kosaraju implementation
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (!vis[i]) { dfs(i); }
	}

	reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

	vector<int> ans(n + 1);
	for (int i : path) {
		if (!vis2[i]) {
			dfs2(i);
			/*
			 * Loop over all cows in the SCC and its preference list.
			 * If a gift is found in its preference and also in the SCC,
			 * just assign the it to the cow.
			 */
			for (int j : comp) {
				for (int k : graph[j]) {
					if (comp.count(k)) {
						ans[j] = k;
						break;
					}
				}
			}
			comp.clear();
		}
	}

	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { cout << ans[i] << endl; }
}
