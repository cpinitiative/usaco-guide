Due to the low bounds on $N$, we can naively simulate the events. We'll sort by arrival time to process the cows in order.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("convention2.in", "r", stdin);
	freopen("convention2.out", "w", stdout);

	int cow_num;
	vector<vector<int>> cows;
	cin >> cow_num;
	for (int c = 0; c < cow_num; c++) {
		int start, duration;
		cin >> start >> duration;
		cows.push_back({c, start, duration});
	}

	// sort by arrival time
	auto cmp = [](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b) {
		return a[1] < b[1];
	};
	sort(cows.begin(), cows.end(), cmp);

	int time = 0;
	int curr = 0;
	int longest_wait = 0;

	// sorted by priority so that the highest seniority starts eating first
	set<vector<int>> waiting;
	// as long as we haven't processed all cows or there are still cows waiting
	while (curr < cow_num || !waiting.empty()) {
		// this cow can be processed.
		if (curr < cow_num && cows[curr][1] <= time) {
			waiting.insert(cows[curr]);
			curr++;
			// no cow waiting, skip to the next cow.
		} else if (waiting.empty()) {
			// set time to the ending time of the next cow.
			time = cows[curr][1] + cows[curr][2];
			curr++;
		} else {
			// process the next cow
			vector<int> next = *waiting.begin();
			longest_wait = max(longest_wait, time - next[1]);

			// set the time to when this cow finishes
			time += next[2];
			waiting.erase(waiting.begin());
		}
	}

	cout << longest_wait << endl;
}

Even though Python doesn't have a sorted set for these operations, it's possible
to simulate the operations needed with a [priority queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html).

```py
import heapq

cows = []
with open("convention2.in") as read:
	for c in range(int(read.readline())):
		start, duration = [int(i) for i in read.readline().split()]
		cows.append((c, start, duration))

# sort by arrival time
cows.sort(key=lambda c: c[1])

time = 0
curr = 0
longest_wait = 0

# sorted by priority so that the highest seniority starts eating first
waiting = []
# as long as we haven't processed all cows or there are still cows waiting
while curr < len(cows) or waiting:
	# this cow can be processed
	if curr < len(cows) and cows[curr][1] <= time:
		heapq.heappush(waiting, cows[curr])
		curr += 1
	# no cow waiting, skip to the next cow
	elif not waiting:
		# set time to the ending time of the next cow
		time = cows[curr][1] + cows[curr][2]
		curr += 1
	else:
		# process the next cow
		next_cow = heapq.heappop(waiting)
		longest_wait = max(longest_wait, time - next_cow[1])

		# set the time to when this cow finishes
		time += next_cow[2]

print(longest_wait, file=open("convention2.out", "w"))
```
