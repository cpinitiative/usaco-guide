This problem is extremely hard for Silver, so don't feel bad if you get stuck on it!

## Explanation

### Initial Analysis

First of all, what really happens during a meeting?

The cows do "bounce" off from each other, but that's
really hard to think about *and* implement.

An alternative way to approach this meeting mechanic is that
the cows swap weights and continue on their way.
If we think about it like that, then we have all the times
the cows will reach the barn because we have their positions and speeds.

Of course, now we have to account for the weights of the cows.

Let's first think about it from the leftmost left-going cow.
If it's the leftmost cow overall, nothing will happen.
However, if there's some cows to the left of it,
it will always take on the weight of the leftmost right-going cow
because that's the cow it will meet last.
More precisely, it will always take on the weight of the leftmost cow *overall*.

Moving on the the second leftmost left-going cow (if there is one),
it will take on the weight of the second leftmost cow *overall*, because
the leftmost cow's weight has been taken.

This pattern generalizes to the following two rules:
* If a cow is going left and is the $n$-th leftmost left-going cow,
  it will always take on the position of the $n$-th leftmost cow *overall*.
* If a cow is going *right* and is the $n$-th *right*most right-going cow,
  it will always take on the position of the $n$-th rightmost cow overall.

With this rule and the previous observations, we can figure out the times
at which cows will reach exits and the weights they will reach it with,
and thus we will know the time at which half the total cows' weight
will have reached a barn.

### Final Solution

Given that we have the end time, we just have to efficiently count the number
of meetings that will occur before that time.

To do this, we iterate through all cows in order, for each left-going cow
seeing how many right-going cows are within their range. We can do this
with a queue and the observation that a left-going cow at position $l$ and
a right-going cow at position $r$ can meet if $l<r$ and $r+2e \geq l$,
where $e$ is the ending time.

<Info>

It's also possible to see how many meetings each right-going cow would have
gone through- we'd just have to go through the cows in reverse.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

	}
	for (int c = 0; c < right.size(); c++) {
		weight_times.push_back(
		    {barn_pos - right[c].pos, cows[left.size() + c].weight});

	// sort them by their occurrence
	std::sort(weight_times.begin(), weight_times.end(),

		          return a.first < b.first;
	          });

	int endTime = -1;
	for (const auto &[time, weight] : weight_times) {
		total_weight -= 2 * weight;
		if (total_weight <= 0) {
			endTime = time;
			break;
		}
	}

	// count how many meetings occur before the end time
	int meeting_num = 0;
	// the cows that a left-going cow can meet before the end time

	for (int c = 0; c < cow_num; c++) {
		if (cows[c].speed == 1) {

		} else if (cows[c].speed == -1) {

			while (!leftSide.empty() &&
			       leftSide.front() + 2 * endTime < cows[c].pos) {

	}
