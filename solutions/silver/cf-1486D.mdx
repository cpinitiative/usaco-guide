## Explanation

We can binary search over the largest possible median that is possible to achieve.

To check whether the median $x$ is achievable on an interval, we need to count the number of elements that are $\ge x$ and the number of elements that are $< x$.

If the number of elements $\ge x$ is greater than the number of elements $< x$, we can say that this median is achievable.
Note that there must be strictly more elements greater than or equal to $x$ than less than $x$ because of how the problem defines the median for subarrays even sizes.

Let $f(i)$ be the number of elements in the prefix that are$\ge x$ - the number of elements in the prefix that are $< x$.

We can prove that if $f(i) - f(j) > 0$ and $i >= j + k$, it is possible to have a median of $x$.
This is because on the range from $i$ to $j$ there will be more elements greater than or equal to $x$ than less than $x$ which means that the median will also be greater than or equal to $x$.

From here we can perform a linear search for the max difference keeping track of the minimum element in the prefix from $0$ to $f[i - k]$ which ensures that the size is always at least $k$. If it greater than $0$, then this median is possible to achieve.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;
	vector<int> a(n);
	for (int &i : a) { cin >> i; }

	// Binary search for the maximum median
	int lo = 1;
	int hi = n;
	while (lo < hi) {
		int median = (lo + hi + 1) / 2;
		// Same as the f described in the editorial
		vector<int> f(n);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			/*
			 * If a[i] is greater than or equal to the median, it
			 * contributes 1 to f(i) Otherwise if it less than the median,
			 * it contributes -1 to f(i)
			 */
			f[i] = a[i] >= median ? 1 : -1;
			if (i) { f[i] += f[i - 1]; }
		}

		// Keeps track of the minimum value of f(x) in the prefix
		int mn = 0;
		int diff = 0;
		// Iterate over the ending pointer of a subarray.
		for (int i = k - 1; i < n; i++) {
			// Update the minimum element in the prefix.
			mn = min(mn, f[i - k]);
			// Update the maximum possible difference.
			diff = max(diff, f[i] - mn);
		}

		// Update binary search bounds.
		if (diff > 0) {
			lo = median;
		} else {
			hi = median - 1;
		}
	}

	cout << lo << endl;
}
