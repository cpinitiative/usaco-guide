<Info title="Constant Time Solution">
**Note: the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ solution for this problem is provided in the
[official editorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/78116).**
</Info>

Consider the following observations:

- Case 1: The number of cups of hot water poured is equal to the number of cups of cold water poured. Pouring an equal number of cups of hot and cold water is equivalent to pouring one cup of each. 
- Case 2: Otherwise, there must be exactly one more cup of hot water poured than cold water poured. Thus, there will be $c_i + 1$ cups of hot water and $c_i$ cups of cold water for some $c_i \geq 0$.
- It can be proven, using induction, that the average barrel temperatures when $c_i$ is odd is a monotonically decreasing function. Thus, we can binary search on the maximum number of odd cups $c_i$ which gives a temperature of at least $t$ by checking the odd integers around it.

The answer will either be the barrel with $2$, $c_i$, or $c_i + 2$ cups.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$
