## Explanation

[Official Analysis](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/51768)

Is there a way to format an ad of a given width using less than or equal to the maximum number of lines?

If we can format an ad using less than or equal to the maximum number of lines, we can binary search for the minimum width that works.

We can break the ad into individual words. We will store each word length plus a space or a hyphen (except for the last word), since spaces and hyphens function similarly.

We will add as many words as possible to each line for each width, creating a new line when we run out of room. If the number of lines we use is less than or equal to the maximum number of lines, then our width works. If any word is longer than our given width, then our width doesn't work.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int max_lines;
vector<int> word_lengths;
string ad;

/** @return if most optimized ad of given width satisfies constraints */
bool width_valid(int width) {
	int lines = 0;
	int cur_width = 0;

	for (int word_length : word_lengths) {
		// if individual word is wider than ad width, we need a greater width
		if (word_length > width) { return false; }

		// if we overflow, we need a new line
		if (cur_width + word_length > width) {
			lines++;
			cur_width = word_length;
		} else {
			cur_width += word_length;  // add word to current line
		}
	}

	if (cur_width > 0) { lines++; }
	return lines <= max_lines;
}

int main() {
	cin >> max_lines;
	// ignore '\n' character before getline
	cin.ignore();
	getline(cin, ad);

	// get sizes of each word, including trailing spaces and trailing hyphens
	word_lengths.push_back(0);
	for (char i : ad) {
		word_lengths.back()++;
		// spaces and hyphens work the same, start new word after adding char
		if (i == ' ' || i == '-') { word_lengths.push_back(0); }
	}

	/*
	 * find the lowest width that doesn't use greater than max_lines
	 * binary search: https://usaco.guide/silver/binary-search
	 */
	int lo = 0;
	int hi = (int)ad.size();
	hi++;
	while (lo < hi) {
		int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
		if (width_valid(mid)) {
			hi = mid;
		} else {
			lo = mid + 1;
		}
	}

	cout << lo << endl;
}
```
