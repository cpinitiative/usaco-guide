## Observation 1

**For 3 operations $X$, $Y$, $Z$ in order, if $Y$ can't undo $X$ and $Z$ can't undo $Y$, then $Z$ can't undo $X$.**

This observation is pretty obvious and doesn't seem very helpful at first, but it will become useful later on.

Before we move on though, view each operation as a node in a graph. If $Y$ undoes $X$, draw an edge between $Y$ and $X - 1$ and let $P_Y = X - 1$.

Notice how the answer for $Y$ is simply the answer for $P_Y$. Additionally, our graph is a forest.

Here's the graph for the sample test case:

## Observation 2

**If $Y$ can't undo $X$, then $Y$ can't undo any operation in the range $(P_X, X]$.**

This is because $P_X + 1$ is the most recent active operation $X$ could undo. The states of the operations in the range $(P_X, X]$ also remain unchanged after applying operation $X$, so by observation 1, this is true. (This still holds when we undo some operations.)

## Observation 3

**By observation 2, the operation we undo must lie on some path from the most recent operation upwards!**

We essentially want the most recent operation with level strictly less than the current **undo**. We can use suffix minimums and binary lifting to find this operation.

## Complexity

Time: $O(N \log N)$.

Memory: $O(N \log N)$.

## Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FOR(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < y; i++)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int anc[300001][20], mn[300001][20], ans[300001];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    FOR(i, 1, n + 1) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        if (x > 0) {
            ans[i] = x;
            anc[i][0] = i;
        } else {
            x = -x;
            int curr = i - 1;
            for (int j = 19; ~j; j--) if (mn[curr][j] >= x) curr = anc[curr][j];
            anc[i][0] = curr - 1;
            ans[i] = ans[curr - 1];
            mn[i][0] = x;
            FOR(j, 1, 20) {
                anc[i][j] = anc[anc[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
                mn[i][j] = min(mn[i][j - 1], mn[anc[i][j - 1]][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    FOR(i, 1, n + 1) cout << ans[i] << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

# Alternative (Ben)

Let `lev[x]=max(0,-a[x])`.

Let `active_y[x]=true` if operation `x` is active after `y` operations, and `false` otherwise. Obviously `active_y[y]=true`.

Let `activepath_y[x]=true` if operation `x` could possibly be undone after another operation, and `false` otherwise. In other words, `active_y[x]=true` and no `z>x` exists with `active_y[z]=true` and `lev[z]<=lev[x]`. If this is the case, we'll say that "`x` lies on the active path of `y`." Obviously, `activepath_y[y]=true`.

**Claim:** If `activepath_y[x]` then `active_y[1..x]=active_x[1..x]`.

**Proof:** We use induction. Suppose that this is true for `y=1..q` and we we want to prove it for `y=q+1`. If `lev[q+1]=0` then `q+1` is the only vertex on the active path for `q+1`, so this obviously holds. Otherwise, assume that operation `q+1` undoes operation `z` on the active path for `q`. By the inductive hypothesis, `active_q[1..z]=active_z[1..z]`, which implies that `active_{q+1}[1..z-1]=active_{z-1}[1..z-1]`.

All operations on the active path for `q+1` aside from `q+1` itself also lie on the active path for `z-1`. Also, for any `t` on the active path for `z-1`, `active_t[1..t]=active_{z-1}[1..t]=active_{q+1}[1..t]`. This completes the proof.

So the solution is to maintain the active path for every `i`. If there exists an operation with level 0 on the active path for `i`, then its state is the answer for `i`; otherwise, the answer for `i` is 0.

```cpp
int state[MX], par[MX][19], lev[MX];

int getPar(int x, int maxLev) { // get last op on active path of x with lev <= maxLev
    if (lev[x] <= maxLev) return x;
    R0F(i,19) if (lev[par[x][i]] > maxLev) x = par[x][i];
    return par[x][0];
}

int main() {
    setIO();
    int n; re(n);
    FOR(y,1,n+1) {
        re(state[y]);
        if (state[y] < 0) {
            lev[y] = -state[y];
            int z = getPar(y-1,lev[y]-1);
            assert(z); // must be something to undo
            par[y][0] = getPar(z-1,lev[y]-1);
            assert(lev[y] > lev[par[y][0]]); // levels of ops in active path are strictly decreasing
            FOR(j,1,19) par[y][j] = par[par[y][j-1]][j-1]; // prep binary jumps
        }
        ps(state[getPar(y,0)]);
        // current active path is y, par[y], par[par[y]], ...
    }
}
```
