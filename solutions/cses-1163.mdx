In this problem, we are given an empty interval of length $x$ spanning from 0 to
$x$, and $n$ points are added to the interval chronologically. We want to find
the largest gap between the points after each step.

## Solution 1 

Let's create a set and a multiset. The set will store
the positions of the traffic lights, while the multiset will keep track of the
"gaps" between the lights. The multiset keeps expanding because more lights are
added, and you just need to print the length of the longest passage without
traffic lights after each addition (i.e. the max element of that multiset). This
element is the last element by default.

Note that when placing a new traffic light on the road, that light will split
the gap between two adjacent lights into two smaller pieces, so you also have to
remove the length of that gap in the multiset and add two new lengths to the
multiset.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

//constant initialization
const int maxn=2e5+10;

//variables used for the current problem
int x,n,p; set<int> lights; multiset<int> dist;

void solve() {
	cin >> x >> n;
	lights.insert(0); lights.insert(x);
	dist.insert(x);
	for (int i=0;i<n;++i){
		cin >> p;
		auto it1 = lights.upper_bound(p),it2 = it1; --it2;
		dist.erase(dist.find(*it1-*it2));
		dist.insert(p-*it2); dist.insert(*it1-p);
		lights.insert(p);
		auto ans = dist.end(); --ans;
		cout << *ans << " ";
	}
}

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
	solve();
	return 0;
}
```

## Solution 2 - Going Backwards
	
We'll start by trying to find the maximum gap once all the traffic lights are
added. This is the last number we'll output, so we'll add it to the end of our
output array. Then, we'll remove traffic lights in the reverse order to how they
were added, and find the gap each removal creates.

This gap is just the distance between the two street coordinates (either a
traffic light or the beginning or ending of the street) next to a given traffic
light stored in our set, so we can use our set to find these values and subtract
them to get our gap.

But this gap may not be the maximum gap. We'll compare this to the gap we found
once all the traffic lights are added, and set the max gap to the greater value.
We'll then set the next lowest element in the output array to this value, which
will represent the greatest gap prior to adding the traffic light we just
removed.
