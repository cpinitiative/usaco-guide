[Official Analysis](https://boi.cses.fi/files/boi2012_solutions.zip)

If we can cover the highway using circles of radius $r_1$, then we can also
cover the highway using circles of radius $r_2 > r_1$. This suggests that we
should binary search for the answer.

## Checking a Radius

If a circle covers a part of a highway, it covers a line segment. Using the
Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$), we can find the coordinates of the
endpoints of each such segment. Let the segment from the $i$-th tower be $s_i$.

Checking whether a radius is good now becomes checking whether the union of
these segments is a single segment that completely covers the highway.

We can solve this in $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ time by sorting the segments by
their left endpoints and then merging each segment into the union if it
intersects the union of the previous segments.

Unfortunately, this is just a bit too slow ($\mathcal{O}(N \log N \log L)$ in
total) and only scores 50 points.

Luckily, we don't have to sort the segments!

### A Nice Property

Why would we need to sort the segments in the first place?

Imagine we had three segments $f$, $g$, and $h$ in that order in the unsorted
list. Watch what happens when these segments are arranged as shown below:

![Hack](<Baltic 12-mobile/hack.png>)

Without sorting, $g$ wouldn't be part of the union since $f \cap g = \emptyset$.
However, the actual union contains all three segments.

But what if $h$ completely covers $g$?

![Antihack](<Baltic 12-mobile/antihack.png>)

In this case, it doesn't matter that $g$ isn't a part of the union, since
$f \cup g \cup h = f \cup h$ anyway.

The nice thing about this particular problem is that if we have segment $s_i$
coming after segment $s_j$ in the list but $s_i$'s left endpoint is to the left
of $s_j$'s left endpoint, then $s_i$ must completely cover $s_j$.

Why is this true? The only time we will have segment $s_i$ coming after segment
$s_j$ in the list but $s_i$'s left endpoint is to the left of $s_j$'s left
endpoint is when $x_i > x_j$ and $y_i < y_j$.

![Circles](<Baltic 12-mobile/circles.png>)

Clearly, $s_i$ completely covers $s_j$. We can therefore apply our algorithm for
a sorted list and still get the correct answer!

This gets rid of the $\log N$ factor in our original complexity and so the final
complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N \log L)$, which is good enough for 100 points.

(There is also an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ solution - try to come up with it yourself!)

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define x first
#define y second
using namespace std;

pair<long long, long long> p[1000000];

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);
	int n, len;
	cin >> n >> len;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> p[i].x >> p[i].y;

	double l = 1, r = 1.5e9;
	while (r - l > 1e-3) {
		double mid = (l + r) / 2, curr = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			double delta = sqrt(mid * mid - p[i].y * p[i].y);
			double a = p[i].x - delta, b = p[i].x + delta;
			if (a <= curr) curr = max(curr, b);
		}

		if (curr >= len) r = mid;
		else l = mid;
	}

	cout << fixed << setprecision(4) << l;
	return 0;
}
```
