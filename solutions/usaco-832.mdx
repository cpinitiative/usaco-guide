## Solution 1

[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_milkorder_bronze_open18.html)

## Solution 2

In this problem, there are three cases that we have to consider:
1. Cow $1$ is fixed: In this case, the solution is simple, as we just output its fixed position.
2. Cow $1$ is in the given hierarchy of cows: In this case, we want to place every cow in the hierarchy as early as possible.
3. Cow $1$ is neither fixed nor in the hierarchy: In this case, we would want to place every cow in the hierarchy as late as possible, such that cow $1$ gets the earliest possible position.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N(M + N))$

```py
file_in = open('milkorder.in')
data = file_in.read().strip().split('\n')
n, m, k = map(int, data[0].split(' '))
hierarchy = list(map(int, data[1].split(' ')))
fixed = [list(map(int, data[i + 2].split(' '))) for i in range(k)]

cows = [0 for i in range(n)]

for i in range(k):
  	cows[fixed[i][1] - 1] = fixed[i][0]

if 1 in cows:
	# Case 1
 	ans = cows.index(1) + 1
else:
	if 1 not in hierarchy:
		# Case 2
		i = n - 1
		pointer = m - 1
		while pointer >= 0:
			if hierarchy[pointer] in cows:
				i = cows.index(hierarchy[pointer]) - 1
				pointer -= 1
			else:
				if cows[i] == 0:
					cows[i] = hierarchy[pointer]
					i -= 1
					pointer -= 1
				else:
					i -= 1

		for i in range(n):
			if cows[i] == 0:
				ans = i + 1
				break
	else:
		# Case 3
		i = 0
		pointer = 0
		while pointer <= m - 1:
			if hierarchy[pointer] in cows:
				i = cows.index(hierarchy[pointer]) + 1
				pointer += 1
			else:
				if cows[i] == 0:
					cows[i] = hierarchy[pointer]
					i += 1
					pointer += 1
				else:
					i += 1
		for i in range(n):
			if cows[i] == 1:
				ans = i + 1
				break

print(ans, file=open('milkorder.out', 'w'))
