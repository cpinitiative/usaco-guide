**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O((K + N) \sqrt N)$.

Let's consider two naive solutions and try to combine them! (In general, this is
a good idea for square-root-decomposition problems.)

## Naive solution 1 - slow update; fast query

Keep an array that stores the number of containers on each position. When we
process a crane, we can simply increment the positions that it puts containers
on.

Querying the final answer only takes $\mathcal O(N)$ time, but processing all of
the cranes can potentially take $\mathcal O(KN)$ time in total.

This solution would work well if **all $d_i$ were large**, as processing each
crane takes $\mathcal O(N / d_i)$ time.

## Naive solution 2 - fast update; slow query

Let $dp[x][y]$ denote the prefix sum of the number of cranes with $d_i = y$ and
$x \equiv a_i \pmod{y}$. When we process a crane, we change exactly two values
in the DP array. The answer for position $p$ is simply

$$
\sum_{y = 0}^{\max(d_i)} \sum_{x \leq p \land x \equiv p \pmod{y}}dp[x][y].
$$

Processing all of the cranes now only takes only $\mathcal O(K)$ time, but
querying the final answer can potentially take $\mathcal O(NK)$ time.

This solution would work well if **all $d_i$ were small**, as we querying the
solution takes $\mathcal O(N \cdot \max(d_i))$ time.

## Model solution - fast(ish) update; fast(ish) query

When $d_i \geq \sqrt N$, then apply solution 1. Otherwise, apply solution 2.

After processing all the cranes, we can simply add the results from the two
solutions.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FOR(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < y; i++)
using namespace std;

const int sqrt_n = 300;
int containers[100001];
int dp[100001 + sqrt_n][sqrt_n];

int main() {
	iostream::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;
	while (k--) {
		int a, l, d;
		cin >> a >> l >> d;
		if (d >= sqrt_n) FOR(i, 0, l) containers[a + i * d]++;
		else {
			dp[a][d]++;
			dp[a + (l * d)][d]--;
		}
	}

	FOR(j, 1, sqrt_n) FOR(i, j, n + 1) dp[i][j] += dp[i - j][j];

	FOR(i, 1, n + 1) {
		FOR(j, 1, sqrt_n) containers[i] += dp[i][j];
		cout << containers[i] << ' ';
	}
}
```
