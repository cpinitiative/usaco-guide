## Approach & Intuition

This problem is a classic combinatorial challenge that cannot be solved by simple permutations (like $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...}$) because the constraint "no adjacent characters are equal" creates complex dependencies.

To solve this efficiently for a string length up to 5000, we use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** combined with the **Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**.



### The Core Idea: "Building Blocks"

Instead of placing characters one by one, we process the string **character group by character group**.

1.  **Group by Frequency:** We first count how many times each character appears (e.g., A: 2, B: 1, C: 1).
2.  **Forming Segments:** For a character appearing $f$ times, we can split it into $k$ distinct segments (or blocks). For example, if we have `aaa`, we could treat it as:
    * 1 segment: `(aaa)`
    * 2 segments: `(aa), (a)` or `(a), (aa)`
    * 3 segments: `(a), (a), (a)`
3.  **Interleaving:** We use DP to track how many ways we can interleave these segments with the segments we have already built from previous characters.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Preprocessing
We count the frequency of every character. We also precompute **Binomial Coefficients** (nCr) using Pascal's Triangle logic. This allows us to calculate combinations in $O(1)$ time during the main algorithm.

### 2. The Dynamic Programming State
We define a DP table:
$$dp[i][j]$$

* $i$: We have processed the first $i$ distinct character types.
* $j$: The total number of **segments** (groups of characters) currently formed.

### 3. The Transition (The Math)
When we introduce a new character with frequency $f$, we decide to split it into $k$ segments.

The number of ways to update the DP state involves two combinatorial calculations:

1.  **Splitting the new character:**
    How many ways can we split frequency $f$ into $k$ non-empty groups? This is a "Stars and Bars" problem:
    $$\binom{f - 1}{k - 1}$$

2.  **Merging with existing segments:**
    If we previously had $j$ segments and we add $k$ new segments, we now have $j+k$ total segments. How many relative orderings exist between the old segments and the new ones?
    $$\binom{j+k}{k}$$

**The Update Rule:**
$$dp[i][j+k] += dp[i-1][j] \times \binom{f-1}{k-1} \times \binom{j+k}{k}$$

### 4. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (The Final Answer)
After processing all character groups, `dp[groups][i]` tells us the number of ways to form a sequence with exactly $i$ segments.

However, simply having segments doesn't guarantee the "no adjacent" rule is met *between* the segments we implicitly created. To get the final answer, we apply Inclusion-Exclusion based on the parity of the string length and segments:

* We sum up the values of $dp[final][i]$.
* If $(n + i)$ is even, we add.
* If $(n + i)$ is odd, we subtract.

const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAX_N = 5005;
const int ALPH = 26;

ll nCr[MAX_N][MAX_N];            // Binomial coefficients table
ll dp[ALPH + 3][MAX_N];          // dp[i][j]: i-th char group, j total segments
ll freq[ALPH];                   // Frequency of each character

int main() {

    }

    // 3. Dynamic Programming
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    int used_len = 0; // Tracks number of segments processed so far

    for(int i = 1; i < (int)counts.size(); i++){

        // Iterate over previous number of segments (j)
        for(int j = 0; j <= used_len; j++){
            // Iterate over how many segments (k) we split the current char into
            for(int k = 1; k <= f; k++){

            }
        }
        used_len += f;
    }
