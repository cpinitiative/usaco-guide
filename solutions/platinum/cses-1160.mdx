In this problem, we are given a functional graph and asked $q$ queries for the
minimum distance between two vertices $u$ and $v$.

## Structure of the Graph

Notice that all functional graphs can be broken down into a bunch of "components".
Each of these components consists of many trees directed towards the root, and
a single cycle composed of said roots and some other nodes.

Here's an example of a possible "component". The trees are circled in red:

Given this, we can essentially break down each query into three cases:

## Both in Tree

If both $u$ and $v$ are in a tree, we first have to get the distance from
each node to the cycle. This can be precalculated for all nodes
with [BFS](/gold/unweighted-shortest-paths).

First of all, if $v$'s distance is greater than that of $u$'s,
we can't get to $v$ because using a teleporter can only *decrease* our distance
to the cycle.

But if this condition isn't satsified, we start at $u$ and use the teleporters
until our distance to the cycle is equal to that of $v$'s. If we've actually
ended up at $v$, then our answer is the difference between the distances.
Otherwise, it's impossible to reach $v$.

To see which planet we end up at if we teleport $t$ times, we can use
[binary jumping](/plat/bin-jump).

## Both in Cycle

If both are in a cycle, we get both $u$ and $v$'s index in the cycle.
Let's call these indices $u_i$ and $v_i$ respectively.
Now, if $u_i \leq v_i$, then our answer is $v_i - u_i$.
On the other hand, if $u_i > v_i$, then our answer is
$\texttt{cycle\_len} - (u_i - v_i)$.


## One in Each

This case is really two cases, but we only really need to consider one of them.

If $u$ is in a cycle but $v$ is in a tree, it's impossible to reach $v$ from $u$
because we can only go from a tree to a cycle, not vice versa.

On the other hand, if $u$ is the one in the tree, we get which node in the cycle
$u$'s tree connects to, which is also the root. Then this reduces to a version
of the second case: we just have to add the distance from $u$ to the root as well.

<Warning>

Note that all three of these cases assume $u$ and $v$ are in the same component.
If they're in different components, we can't reach $v$ from $u$.

</Warning>

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}((n+q)\log n)$
