## Solution 1

[Official Analysis (Java)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_circlecross_bronze_feb17.html)

### Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of cows.

<!-- Solution -->

Define $Start_x$ and $End_x$ to be the indices of the first and last occurrences
of cow $x$ in the input string, respectively. We want to count the number of
pairs of cows $(i,j)$ such that cow $i$ enters before cow $j$ and leaves
somewhere between cow $j$'s entry and exit. In other words,
$Start_i < Start_j < End_i < End_j$.

Since $N$ is small, we can afford to iterate over all possibilities for $i$ and
$j$ and check whether the condition above is satisfied in $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
time.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("circlecross.in","r",stdin);
	freopen("circlecross.out","w",stdout);
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	int Start[26], End[26];
	// Set all elements of Start and End arrays to -1.
	fill(Start, Start + 26, -1);
	fill(End, End + 26, -1);
	for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
		if (Start[s[i]-'A'] == -1) Start[s[i]-'A'] = i;
		else End[s[i]-'A'] = i;
	}
	int ans = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
		for (int j = 0; j < 26; ++j)
			ans += Start[i] < Start[j] && Start[j] < End[i] && End[i] < End[j];
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

## Solution 2

Due to the low constraints, we can iterate over all $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ possible
pairs of intersecting paths and check whether they represent two cows.
	
### Implementation
	
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$

<LanguageSection>
	
<PySection>
	
```python	
fin = open('circlecross.in', 'r')
s = fin.readline().strip()
ans = 0

# Iterates through all possible pairs.
for a in range(len(s)):
	for b in range(a + 1, len(s)):
		for c in range(b + 1, len(s)):
			for d in range(c + 1, len(s)):
				ans += s[a] == s[c] and s[b] == s[d]

fout = open('circlecross.out', 'w')
fout.write(str(ans) + '\n')
fout.close()
```
	
</PySection>
	
<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	freopen("circlecross.in","r",stdin);
	freopen("circlecross.out","w",stdout);
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	int ans = 0;
	for (int a = 0; a < s.size(); a++)
		for (int b = a+1; b < s.size(); b++)
			for (int c = b+1; c < s.size(); c++)
				for (int d = c+1; d < s.size(); d++)
					ans += s[a] == s[c] && s[b] == s[d];
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

<JavaSection>
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class CrossingCows {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio("circlecross");
		String s = io.next();
		int ans = 0; 

		// Iterate through all characters of the string
		for (int a = 0; a < s.length(); a++) {
		for (int b = a + 1; b < s.length(); b++) {
			for (int c = b + 1; c < s.length(); c++) {
				for (int d = c + 1; d < s.length(); d++) {
					/* 
					 * If we find two entry/exit paths such that a < b < c < d, 
					 * the path of cows crossing (a, c) and (b, d) must intersect,
					 * so we have a crossing pair (only one-we can't count the pair twice) 
					 */
					if (s.charAt(a) == s.charAt(c) && s.charAt(b) == s.charAt(d)) {
						ans++;
					}
				}
			}
		}
		io.print(ans);
		io.close();
	}
	
	//CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

## Solution 3

For every cow (say cow $N$), we can check which cows have one entry/exit point between both of cow $N$'s entry and exit points. Then, we can add each of these cows as a pair with cows $N$ to a list of crossings, making sure we have no repeats. Then we can just output the length of this list of crossings to get our final answer.

### Implementation
	
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(T^3)$, where $T$ represents the total number of characters in Farmer John's string.

<LanguageSection>
	
<PySection>
	
```python
TOTAL = 52
	
recordings = open('circlecross.in').read().strip()
crossings = []
for i in range(TOTAL):
	if i == recordings.index(recordings[i]):
		# First appearance of letter
		continue
	else:
		appearances = []
		# Make a list of all cows that have an entry/exit point between the entry and exit point of the current cow
		for j in range(recordings.index(recordings[i]) + 1, i):
			if recordings[j] in appearances:
				appearances.remove(recordings[j])
			else:
				appearances.append(recordings[j])
		# Add all pairs to the crossings list if not already in it
		for k in appearances:
			if [recordings[i], k] not in crossings and [k, recordings[i]] not in crossings:
				crossings.append([recordings[i], k])

print(len(crossings), file=open('circlecross.out', 'w'))
```
