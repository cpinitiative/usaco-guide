[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_haircut_gold_open20.html)

First, we need to count the number of inversions. (Fun fact: the number of
inversions is also a measure of how sorted an array is. If an array has 0
inversions, it's perfectly sorted in ascending order. Conversely, if it has the
maximum possible number of inversions, the array is perfectly sorted in
descending order.)

One way to count inversions is to use a binary indexed tree. Think of an
inversion as a pair of values $a, b$, with $a > b$ and $a$ appearing before $b$
in the array. Then we can easily compute, for each value in the array, the
number of inversions for which it is $b$.

To do this, we use a BIT as a frequency table, keeping track of the number of
hairs of each possible value. If our BIT is named `tree`, `tree[i]` will tell us
how many times $i$ is seen in the array of hairs. The trick is that as long as
we fill out the frequency table in the order the elements appear in the array,
we can also use the frequency table to count the number of inversions, because
at each point in time the frequency table only contains hairs to the left of the
hair we are currently considering.

That leads us to this algorithm:

1. Initialize a BIT so that the frequency of each value is 0.
2. Create an array `inversions`. `inversions[b]` will store the number of
   inversion pairs with the second value being $b$
3. For each hair $h$ in the order it appears in the array (with $h$ being the
   length of the hair):
   1. Count the number of taller hairs that appear before hair $h$ in the array
      (which is, at this point in time, just the frequencies of all values
      greater than $h$). Store this in `inversions[h]`.
   2. Increment the frequency of $h$ in the BIT.

The number of inversions would then be the sum of all the values we computed in
step 3.1. However, we also need to consider the haircuts. If we cut all hairs
greater than length $n$ to $n$, what does that mean? It means that there can be
no inversions with a $b \geq n$, because the definition of an inversion is that
$a > b$, but if $b \geq n$ then $a > n$ must also be true. However, if this is
true, then both $a$ and $b$ would have been cut to length $n$, and $(a, b)$
would no longer be an inversion.

Thus, the number of inversions if all hairs greater than $n$ are cut to length
$n$ is simply the sum of the first $n - 1$ elements of the inversions array (if
$n$ is 0 then all hairs are 0 units long, so there are 0 inversions for
$n = 0$). This is basically just the prefix sum of the `inversions` array.
