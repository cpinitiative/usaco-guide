## Explanation

_Note that this is very tricky for a bronze problem!_

Since $k$ can be as big as $10^{18}$, there is no way we can approach this
problem through brute force. Instead, we'll need to work out an algorithm that
can answer queries in logarithmic time.

Let's group numbers by how many digits they have. An observation we can make is
that for any $n \geq 1$, there are $9 \cdot 10^{n-1}$ numbers in the group with
numbers of length $n$. Additionally, for each group, the total count of digits
from all of the group's numbers combined is $n$ times how many numbers are in
the group. For instance:

- Length $1$ numbers: $1\dots 9\rightarrow$ $9$ numbers $\rightarrow1\cdot9=9$
  digits total
- Length $2$ numbers: $10\dots 99\rightarrow$ $90$ numbers
  $\rightarrow2\cdot90=180$ digits total
- Length $3$ numbers: $100\dots 999\rightarrow$ $900$ numbers
  $\rightarrow3\cdot900=2700$ digits total
- And so on...

To find which group the number that contains the $k$-th digit is in, we can
iterate through groups until the sum of the total number of digits from all the
groups we've processed becomes greater than or equal to $k$. In other words, we
continue increasing the number of groups we look at (starting from $1$-digit
numbers) until the following is true:

$$
\sum^{\text{\# of groups}}_{n=1}{n\cdot9\cdot10^{n-1}\geq k}
$$

Once the condition becomes true, we know that the $k$-th digit must fall into
the last group used in the sum. We can now calculate the $k$-th digit's position
in the group by subtracting $k$ by the total number of digits from all groups
before it. We'll call this relative position $j$:

$$
j=k-1-\sum^{\text{\# of groups}-1}_{n=1}{n\cdot9\cdot10^{n-1}}
$$

Note that we subtract $1$ from the result in order to make $j$ $0$-based (which
makes it more convenient to solve the rest of the problem). For example, if
$j=0$, that would mean the $k$-th digit is the first digit in the group. If
$j=100$, that would mean the $k$-th digit is the $99$-th digit in the group,
etc. From there, we can divide $j$ by $n$ (the length of the numbers in the
group), which gives us the position of the number that contains the $k$-th digit
within the group (also $0$-based). Similarly as before, a position of $0$ means
that the number is the first number in the group, and a position of $100$ means
that the number is the $99$-th number in the group.

To calculate the exact number the $k$-th digit is in, we can add the position of
the number within the group (which we just found) to the value of the first 
number of the group, which is just $10^{n-1}$ (you can find this pattern from the 
beginning example). Now, all that's left is finding the position of the $k$-th 
digit within the number that it's in. We can calculate that by taking 
$j \bmod n$, which finds the remainder of $j$ when divided by $n$. For example, 
let's look at the first $12$ digits in the group with length $3$ numbers:

<center>

| Digit Sequence | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $2$ | $1$ | $0$  | $3$  |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| **Position**   | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $8$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ |

</center>

As you can see, for each $3$-digit number in the digit sequence, the first digit
is always at a position that's a multiple of $3$, meaning the position modulo
$3$ equals $0$. Similarly, the second digit in each number is always at a
position that's $1$ plus a multiple of $3$, meaning its position modulo $3$
equals $1$. Finally, the third digit in each number is always $2$ plus a
multiple of $3$, meaning that its position modulo $3$ equals $2$. This pattern
extends for numbers of all sizes, and it is thus why we can use the modulo
operator to determine the $k$-th digit's $0$-based position within the number
it's inside.

Now, we can calculate our answer by converting the number that the $k$-th digit
is in into a string and indexing it at the position we've just found.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(q\log{k})$
