[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_moobuzz_silver_dec19.html)

For every $15$ numbers, there are only $8$ numbers where the cows moo. (see below)

$ [\underline{1}, \underline{2}, 3, \underline{4}, 5, 6, \underline{7}, \underline{8}, 9, 10, \underline{11}, 12, \underline{13}, \underline{14}, 15] $

$ [\underline{16}, \underline{17}, 18, \underline{19}, 20, 21, \underline{22}, \underline{23}, 24, 25, \underline{26}, 27, \underline{28}, \underline{29}, 30] $

Therefore, we can just get the distance away $N$ is from the first $8$ by calculating  $\lfloor \frac{N}{8} \rfloor \times 15$, since we have to add $15$ for every grouping of $15$. 

Now it's just a matter of adding the corresponding first $8$ to the answer. 

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $ \mathcal{O}(1)$
<LanguageSection>
<PySection>
```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open('moobuzz.in', 'r')
sys.stdout = open('moobuzz.out', 'w')

N = int(input())

# Lists the first 8. 
# 14 is in the zeroth position since if were trying to find the 
# eighth number, 8 % 8 = 0.
first8 = [14, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13]

# Finds the group.
ans = (N - 1) // 8 

# Distance away N is from the first 8.
ans *= 15

# Adds the corresponding element.
ans += first8[N % 8]

print(ans)
