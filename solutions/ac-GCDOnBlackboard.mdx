**Time Complexity:**
$\mathcal{O}(N+\log(\max a_i))$

<Spoiler title="Time Complexity Proof">

At first glance, one might think the task of finding the GCD of an array of integers will take $\mathcal{O}(N\log(\max a_i))$ time
as each GCD operation takes atmost $\mathcal{O}(\log(\max a_i))$ time. However, as each GCD operation will decrease the maximum of $(a,b)$
by at least a factor of 2, there could only be a total of $\mathcal{O}(\log (\max a_i))$ GCD operations
as opposed to $\mathcal{O}(N \log(\max a_i))$ operations (The smallest possible GCD is 1 by definition). Hence the total time complexity of this problem is $\mathcal{O}(N+\log(\max a_i))$
as stated previously.

## Solution
The problem asks us to find the maximum possible GCD of the remaining $N-1$ numbers
after taking any one of them away. Naively trying every single combination will result in a
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2 + N \log(\max a_i))$ as there are $N$ different ways to take away a number and calculating
the GCD will take $\mathcal{O}(N+\log(\max a_i))$ time per case. 

To speed this process up, we can calculate the GCDs of every prefix and suffix. Let $l[i] = \gcd_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$ and $r[i] = \gcd_{j=i}^{N} a[j]$.
Then the answer is the maximum of $\gcd(l[i-1],r[i+1]),$ $i \in [1,N]$.

```cpp

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int maxN = 1e5 + 5;

int arr[maxN];
int prefGcd[maxN]; //prefGcd[i] = GCD of a1,a2, ..., ai
int suffGcd[maxN]; //suffGcd[i] = GCD of ai, ai+1, ..., an
int N;

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);
	cin >> N;
	for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)cin >> arr[i];

	prefGcd[0] = 0;
	suffGcd[N + 1] = 0;

	for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i){
		prefGcd[i] = gcd(prefGcd[i - 1], arr[i]);
	}

	for(int i = N; i >= 1; --i){
		suffGcd[i] = gcd(suffGcd[i + 1], arr[i]);
	}

	int res = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i){
		res = max(res, gcd(prefGcd[i - 1], suffGcd[i + 1]));
	}
	cout << res << '\n';
}
