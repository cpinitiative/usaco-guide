In this problem, we're asked the minimum number of rooms needed to accommodate
$n$ customers, which arrive and leave on set days.

# Main Idea

- First Step: Sort by arrival time (we cannot have a customer arriving at say,
  time 3, occupying a room before a customer arriving at time 2).
- Second Step: Maintain a minimum heap which stores the time a hotel room will
  be unoccupied.
  - Every time a new customer arrvies, we check to see if the minimum element in
    the heap is less than the arrival time of the new customer.
  - If this is true, we can just switch the times.
  - If not, then we need to add another room to the heap.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;


int N;
int ans[200005];
vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int> > v(200005);


int main() {
	cin >> N;
	v.resize(N);
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		cin >> v[i].first.first >> v[i].first.second;
		v[i].second = i; // store the original index
	}
	sort(v.begin(), v.end());


	int rooms = 0, last_room = 0;
	priority_queue<pair<int, int> > pq; // min heap to store departure times.
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		if (pq.empty()) {
			last_room++;
			pq.push(make_pair(-v[i].first.second, last_room)); // make the departure time negative so that we create a min heap (cleanest way to do a min heap... default is max in c++)
			ans[v[i].second] = last_room;
		}
		else {
			pair<int, int> minimum = pq.top(); // accessing the minimum departure time.
			if (-minimum.first < v[i].first.first) {
				pq.pop();
				pq.push(make_pair(-v[i].first.second, minimum.second));
				ans[v[i].second] = minimum.second;
			}

			else {
				last_room++;
				pq.push(make_pair(-v[i].first.second, last_room));
				ans[v[i].second] = last_room;
			}
		}


		rooms = max(rooms, int(pq.size()));
	}


	cout << rooms << "\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		cout << ans[i] << " ";
	}
}
```
