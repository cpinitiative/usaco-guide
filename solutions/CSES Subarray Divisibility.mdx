# Problem

We are asked to find the number of subarrays that are divisible by its size given the array.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

With our prefix sums knowledge, 
$$
\texttt{sum}(i, j) = \texttt{sum}(0, j) - \texttt{sum}(0, i-1).
$$

We can also transform any 
$$
\texttt{sum}(i, j) = \texttt{quotient} \cdot N + \texttt{remainder}.
$$

From this we get that 
$$
\texttt{sum}(i, j) = (\texttt{quotient2} - \texttt{quotient1}) \cdot N + (\texttt{remainder2} - \texttt{remainder1}).
$$

For this to be divisible by $N$, $\texttt{remainder2} - \texttt{remainder1}$ must be equal to $0$. 

Define $\texttt{pmod}[i]$ to be the number of prefixes with remainder equivalent to $i\pmod{N}$. Then the number of pairs contributed by $i$ is

$$
\texttt{pmod}[i] \cdot (\texttt{pmod}[i] - 1) / 2.
$$

The answer is just the sum of this quantity over all $i$.

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

/**

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);

	int N;
	cin >> N;

	vector<long long> M(N);
	long long psums = 0;
	M[psums] = 1;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		int a;
		cin >> a;
		psums += a;
		// Remember to account for negative sums
		M[((psums % N) + N) % N]++;
	}

	long long ans = 0;
	for (long long x : M) {
		// Calculating the # of pairs. This calculates the pairs without duplicates and reverse groups.
		ans += (x * (x-1))/2;
	}
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```
