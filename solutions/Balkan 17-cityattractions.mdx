## Introduction

Let the node that Gigel goes to from node $i$ be $t_i$. Since the graph made from the directed edges $i \rightarrow t_i$ is a [functional graph](/silver/func-graphs), we can use [binary jumping](/plat/binjump) or any other efficient method to find the final node.

Now we only need to find all $t_i$ and we are done! However, this isn't as straightforward as it sounds...

## A simpler problem

Let's consider a simpler problem: suppose we root the tree at node 1 and Gigel can only move down the tree (don't worry about the leaves).

In this problem, we can find all $t_i$ (and $a[t_i] - dist(i, t_i)$) using a simple tree DP:

Let $dp[i]$ be such that $a[dp[i]] - dist(i, dp[i])$ is maximized. Additionally, we store this value in the DP array.

We can then find $dp[i]$ by taking the best of the best of $i$'s children and their $dp[c]$.

This algorithm runs in $O(N)$ time.

## Finding all $t_i$

Obviously, the solution to the simpler problem doesn't solve the general problem: we might need to move up into a node's parent!

To address this issue, we can first do a DFS to find $dp$ as defined above, and then do a second DFS to allow moving to a node's parent. See the [solving for all roots module](/gold/all-roots) if you're unfamiliar with this technique. Essentially, we find the best destination from $i$ if we move up into $i$'s parent and then compare that with $dp[i]$.

After doing this, $dp[i]$ is simply $t_i$ as desired.

These two DFSes run in $O(N)$ time, so the final complexity is $O(N + \log K)$ (from the binary jumping).

## Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

int a[300001], nxt[2][300001];
pair<int, int> dp[300001], pdp[300001];
vector<int> graph[300001];

void dfs1(int node = 1, int parent = 0) {
    dp[node] = {INT_MAX / 2, 0};
    for (int i : graph[node]) if (i != parent) {
        dfs1(i, node);
        dp[node] = min({dp[node], {dp[i].first + 1, dp[i].second}, {1 - a[i], i}});
    }
}

void dfs2(int node = 1, int parent = 0) {
    dp[node] = min(dp[node], pdp[node]);
    pair<int, int> tmp = {pdp[node].first + 1, pdp[node].second};
    tmp = min(tmp, {1 - a[node], node});
    for (int i : graph[node]) if (i != parent) {
        pdp[i] = min(pdp[i], tmp);
        tmp = min({tmp, {dp[i].first + 2, dp[i].second}, {2 - a[i], i}});
    }
    reverse(graph[node].begin(), graph[node].end());
    tmp = {pdp[node].first + 1, pdp[node].second};
    tmp = min(tmp, {1 - a[node], node});
    for (int i : graph[node]) if (i != parent) {
        pdp[i] = min(pdp[i], tmp);
        tmp = min({tmp, {dp[i].first + 2, dp[i].second}, {2 - a[i], i}});
    }
    for (int i : graph[node]) if (i != parent) dfs2(i, node);
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n;
    ll k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        pdp[i] = {INT_MAX / 2, 0};
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        graph[u].push_back(v);
        graph[v].push_back(u);
    }
    dfs1();
    dfs2();

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) nxt[0][i] = dp[i].second;
    int curr = (k & 1 ? nxt[0][1] : 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < 63; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) nxt[i & 1][j] = nxt[i - 1 & 1][nxt[i - 1 & 1][j]];
        if (k & (1ll << i)) curr = nxt[i & 1][curr];
    }
    cout << curr << '\n';
    return 0;
}
