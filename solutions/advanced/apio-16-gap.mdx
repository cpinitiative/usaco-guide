## Subtask 1

We can find the minimum and maximum elements of $a$ in some range $[l, r]$ by
simply querying `MinMax(l, r, &mn, &mx)`. This lets us "whittle down" the range
and reconstruct $a$ with $M \leq \frac{N + 1}{2}$.

We can then sweep throught $a$ and find the largest gap.

## Subtask 2

We don't necessarily need to reconstruct $a$ entirely to find the largest gap.
Notice how if we know a lowerbound $x$ on the answer and the range of all $a_i$,
then we can simply query the range in blocks of size $x - 1$ to find the answer.
This works because the largest gap will always span at least two blocks.

So what is the lowerbound on the answer? If there are $N$ elements that span a
range of size $L$, then the lowerbound is $\frac{L + N - 1}{N - 1}$ by the
pigeonhole principle. (This is a similar idea to the $\alpha = 1/2$ solution for
IMO 2020 P6).

Our algorithm thus looks like:

- Find the range that $a$ spans in 1 query. This contributes $N + 1$ to $M$.
- Find $x$ (the lowerbound on the answer) from the formula above.
- Query the range in blocks of size $x - 1$. Since there are $N - 1$ of these
  blocks and each $a_i$ is included in exactly 1 of these blocks, this
  contributes $2N - 1$ to $M$.

This allows us to find the largest gap with $M \leq 3N$.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include "gap.h"

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

const ll MAXN = 1e18;

ll a[100000], j = 0;

ll findGap(int T, int N) {
	if (T == 1) {
		ll l = 1, r = MAXN;
		ll mn, mx;
		vector<ll> v;
		for (ll i = 0; i < (N + 1) / 2; i++) {
			MinMax(l, r, &mn, &mx);
			a[j++] = mn;
			a[j++] = mx;
			l = mn + 1, r = mx - 1;
		}
		sort(a, a + N);
		ll ans = 0;
		for (ll i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) ans = max(ans, a[i + 1] - a[i]);
		return ans;
	} else {
		ll mn, mx;
		MinMax(1, MAXN, &mn, &mx);
		ll step = (mx - mn + N - 2) / (N - 1);
		ll ans = step, x, y, l = mn, i;
		for (i = mn; i + step < mx; i += step + 1) {
			MinMax(i, i + step, &x, &y);
			if (x != -1) {
				ans = max(ans, x - l);
				l = y;
			}
		}
		MinMax(i, mx, &x, &y);
		if (x != -1) ans = max(ans, x - l);
		return ans;
	}
}
```
