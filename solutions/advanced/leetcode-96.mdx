title: Unique Binary Search Trees

## Explanation

The crucial observation here is that the answer for $n$ nodes is the $n$th Catalan number.

<Spoiler title = "Proof">

Let's consider a binary search tree(BST) with $k$ as the root.
In this case:
- The left subtree will have $k - 1$ nodes with values less than $k$.
- The right subtree will have $n - k$ nodes with values greater than $k$.

As a result, the problem of counting the number of unique BSTs with $n$ nodes can be simplified to
counting the number of unique BSTs that can be built with $k - 1$ nodes in the left subtree and $n - k$ nodes in the right subtree.

Let $C_n$ be the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with $n$ nodes.
Since the root of the tree can be any of the $n$ values, we can get the following recurrence relation:
$$
C_n= \sum^{n}_{k=1}{C_{k - 1} \cdot C_{n - k}}
$$
which by inspection, is identical to the definition of the $n$th Catalan number.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<LanguageSection>
<CPPSection>

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
	long long nCr(int n, int k) {
		long long res = 1;

		// since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k)
		if (k > n - k) { k = n - k; }

		for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
			res *= (n - i);
			res /= (i + 1);
		}

		return res;
	}

	int numTrees(int n) { return nCr(2 * n, n) / (n + 1); }
};
```

</CPPSection>
<PySection>

```py
import math


class Solution:
	def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
		res = math.comb(2 * n, n) // (n + 1)
		return res
```
