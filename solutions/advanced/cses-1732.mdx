## Explanation

In this problem, we are tasked with finding all border lengths of a given string. A border of a string is a prefix that is also a suffix of the string but not the whole string. We employ a variation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to efficiently solve this problem.

The approach involves constructing a prefix function \( p[] \), which stores the length of the longest proper border ending at each position in the string. We iterate through the string and update \( p[] \) accordingly, taking care to handle cases where the characters encountered do not match. Finally, we traverse \( p[] \) backwards to find all border lengths, as they represent the lengths of the longest proper borders ending at each position.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
**Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
