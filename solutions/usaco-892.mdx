[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_sleepy_bronze_jan19.html)

We can think about this problem by looking at the end of the array of cows. Notice that if the last $i$ elements in the array are sorted in increasing order, FJ can fully sort the cows in $n-i$ time steps. This is because the first $n-i$ elements are still to be sorted. Thus, we can find the last unsorted cow and output its position.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```python
file_in = open('sleepy.in')
data = file_in.read().strip().split('\n')

n = int(data[0])
cows = list(map(int, data[1].split(' ')))

ans = 0

# Find the number of strictly increasing values at the end of the list
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
	if cows[i] < cows[i - 1]:
		ans = i
		break

file_out = open('sleepy.out', 'w')
file_out.write(str(ans))
file_out.close()
```
