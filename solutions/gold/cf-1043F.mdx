Try to construct an upper bound on the maximum number of elements needed for a GCD of 1.

What's the maximum number of distinct prime factors you can cram into
a number that's at most $3 \cdot 10^5$?

Let $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i][\texttt{gcd}]$ be the number of ways to select a

<Spoiler title="Hint 4">

Computing $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i]$ from $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i-1]$ seems to be nigh-impossible.
Could there be an alternate way to compute it?
What about if we calculated it from $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i]$ itself?

## Explanation

### An Upper Bound of the Answer

Notice that a number less than $3 \cdot 10^5$ has at most 6 prime factors.
Code it out in your favorite language if you're unconvinced by this!

Now, we can deduce that any answer to the problem must less than 7
(excluding the case where it's impossible).

To see why this is true, say we had an element with 6 prime factors
(the maximum amount) in the subset we were constructing.
With an additional element, the GCD of that subset should probably have 1 less
prime factor.
If it doesn't reduce the number of prime factors, there's no sense in including it
in the first place.

### Dynamic Programming

Now, we let $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i][\texttt{gcd}]$
be the number of ways to select a subset of size $i$
from the given array with a GCD of $\texttt{gcd}$
(If you read the hints you should've already seen this).

We calculate $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i][\texttt{gcd}]$ not from $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i-1]$,
but actually from $\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i]$ itself!

Our transition is as follows:

$$
\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i][\texttt{gcd}]=\binom{x}{i}-\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}{\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i][k \cdot \texttt{gcd}]}
$$

In this formula, $x$ is the number of elements in our set that are divisible by $\texttt{gcd}$.
We initially count the raw number of $\texttt{size}-i$ subsets with the binomial, but
notice that we actually overcount: it's possible that we included a subset with GCD $2k$

To remedy this, we subtract the sum over all multiples of $\texttt{gcd}$ to account
for this initial error.

Iterating over $i$ from 1 to 7 and $\texttt{gcd}$ from $M$ to 1,
where $M$ is the maximum element given in the input,
we can now check if there's a subset of size $i$ with a GCD of 1 by checking
$\texttt{gcd\_ways}[i][1]$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log M (N + M))$, where $M$ is the same as above.

from math import comb

MOD = 10**9 + 7
ANS_UB = 7

n = int(input())

nums = {int(i) for i in input().split()}
max_ = max(nums)

div_by_num = [0 for _ in range(max_ + 1)]
for d in range(1, max_ + 1):
	for mul in range(d, max_ + 1, d):
		div_by_num[d] += mul in nums

for i in range(1, ANS_UB + 1):
	gcd_ways = [0 for _ in range(max_ + 1)]
	for j in range(max_, 0, -1):
		val = comb(div_by_num[j], i)
		for j_mul in range(2 * j, max_ + 1, j):
			val -= gcd_ways[j_mul]
		gcd_ways[j] = val

	if gcd_ways[1] > 0:
		print(i)
		break
else:
	print(-1)
```

Since C++ can't store huge numbers, we have to use a modulus to do our calculations.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
constexpr int ANS_UB = 7;

long long pow(long long base, long long exp) {
	base %= MOD;
	long long res = 1;
	while (exp > 0) {
		if (exp % 2 == 1) { res = res * base % MOD; }
		base = base * base % MOD;
		exp /= 2;
	}
	return res;
}

long long mod_inv(long long n) { return pow(n, MOD - 2); }

int main() {
	int n;
	std::cin >> n;

	vector<long long> fact(n + 1);
	fact[0] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % MOD; }
	auto comb = [&](int n, int k) {
		if (n < k) { return 0LL; }
		return fact[n] * mod_inv(fact[k] * fact[n - k] % MOD) % MOD;
	};

	std::set<int> nums;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int x;
		std::cin >> x;
		nums.insert(x);
	}

	int max = *std::max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
	vector<int> div_by_num(max + 1);
	for (int d = 1; d <= max; d++) {
		for (int mul = d; mul <= max; mul += d) {
			div_by_num[d] += nums.count(mul);
		}
	}

	for (int i = 1; i <= ANS_UB; i++) {
		vector<long long> gcd_ways(max + 1);
		for (int j = max; j >= 1; j--) {
			long long val = comb(div_by_num[j], i);
			for (int j_mul = 2 * j; j_mul <= max; j_mul += j) {
				val = (val - gcd_ways[j_mul] + MOD) % MOD;
			}
			gcd_ways[j] = val;
		}

		if (gcd_ways[1] > 0) {
			cout << i << endl;
			return 0;
		}
	}

	cout << -1 << endl;
}
