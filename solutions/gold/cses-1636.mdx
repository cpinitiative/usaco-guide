<!-- This problem is very to similar Coin Combinations I, with the main difference being that we only count ordered combinations.  -->

<Info title="Note">
The solution for this problem is very similar to that of
[Coin Combinations I](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1635). If you haven't solved that already, we recommend doing so before attempting this problem.
</Info>

The key difference between this problem and
[Coin Combinations I](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1635) is that we're now
trying to find the number of **ordered** ways to add the coins to $x$. This
means that if we had coins $\{1, 3, 5\}$ and $x=4$, adding $1 + 3$ is treated as
the same "way" as $3 + 1$.

## Solution

We'll let $\texttt{dp}[w]$ equal the number of ordered ways to add the coins up
to $w$. In the previous problem, we tried out each coin for each possible $w$.
Here, we'll do the reverse, looping through all possible $w$ ($0\leq w \leq x$)
for each coin $i$ while updating $\texttt{dp}$ as follows:

$$
\texttt{dp}[w] := \texttt{dp}[w] + \texttt{dp}[w-\texttt{coins}[i]]
$$

This essentially entails switching the order of the nested loops from the
previous problem. Since we now loop over the coins before the weights, we only
go through the set of coins once, so it's impossible to create two combinations
with the same set of coins ordered differently.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot x)$
