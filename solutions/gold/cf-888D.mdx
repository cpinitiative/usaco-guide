We can iterate from $0$ to $k$ and shuffle exactly $k$ positions of the permutation. After shuffling, exactly $k$ positions of the permutation should be different while the remaining positions remain the same to fulfill the almost identity criterion.

Let's consider how to count the ways to shuffle exactly $m$ positions of the permutation. First we need to choose exactly $m$ positions in the permutations out of $n$ indices which is ${n \choose m}$. Now let’s consider how to shuffle the $m$ positions. We can consider permutations. However, in some permutations, all positions aren’t completely shuffled.

For example, if $n = 4$.

The identity permutation will be $1$ $2$ $3$ $4$.

Let’s say that we want to rearrange the first 3 elements.

One possible permutation is: $1$ $3$ $2$ $4$.

In this permutation, the first element is still in this same place, which is not the desired outcome (we didn't shuffle all the elements we want to rearrange).

Thus, we need to find all permutations where all the elements are out of place. However, since k is relatively small, we can brute force permutations to find the number of valid permutations.

We can add the number of valid permutations multiplied by the number of ways to choose a permutation of that length.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NK)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;

	// Use Pascal's Identity to precalculate combinations.
	ll c[n + 1][k + 1];
	fill_n(&c[0][0], (n + 1) * (k + 1), 0);
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) { c[i][0] = 1; }
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
			c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1];
		}
	}

	ll ans = 0;
	// Iterate over number of positions to shuffle.
	for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {

		// Calculate number of valid permutations result in all positions
		// shuffled.
		int a[i];
		for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) a[j] = j;
		int amt = 0;
		do {
			bool valid = 1;
			for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
				if (a[j] == j) valid = 0;
			if (valid) amt++;
		} while (next_permutation(a, a + i));

		// Add the number of valid permutations of i elements multiplied by the
		// number of ways to choose i elements.
		ans += c[n][i] * amt;
	}

	cout << ans << endl;
}
