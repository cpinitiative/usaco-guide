**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log K)$

## Abstract

Finding the difference between sums of the upper $K/2$ elements and lower $K/2$
with two multisets.

<Warning>

The implementation of this solution assumes familarity with
[Sliding Median](/gold/sliding#problem-cses-1076) as their implementations are
near identical.

</Warning>

## Solution

### The cost of a window

It can be shown that it is optimal to change the values of the window to the
median (left as an exercise :D). Once we find the median, we must find the sum
of the distances of all elements to the median. Summing the distances for each
element individually is too slow. Instead, we'll split the elements in the
window into two groups and calculate the cost as described below. The smallest
$K/2$ elements in the window will be in the lower group while the largest $K/2$
elements in the window will be in the upper group.

The cost of the window can be expressed as a function of $K,S_1,S_2$, and $M$,
where $S_1$ and $S_2$ denote the sum of elements in the lower and upper group
respectively, and $M$ denotes the median of the window. The cost of the lower
group will be $\sum_{i=1}^{K/2} M-e_i$, and the cost of the upper group will be
$\sum_{i=1}^{K/2} e_i-M$, where $e$ represents an element in the group. These
expressions can be simplified to $M\times K/2 - S_1$ and $S_2 - M\times K/2$.
The total cost of the window is the sum of the costs contributed by both groups,
or $S_2-S_1$.

## Implementation

Finding the difference between the largest $K/2$ elements in the window and the
smallest $K/2$ elements in the window is similar to finding the sliding median
(more info [here](/solutions/cses-1076?lang=cpp)). To maintain the current cost,
we keep track of the sum of each multiset as we insert and erase. Using the
double multiset method described in the Sliding Median solution, we let the
lower group include the lower $\lceil K/2 \rceil$ elements in the window. As a
result, when the window size is odd, the lower group has one more than element
than the desired amount. We can correct for this by adding the median to the
final answer if the window size is odd.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll mn = (ll)2e5 + 5;

ll N, K;
ll arr[mn];
multiset<ll> up;
multiset<ll> low;
ll sLow, sUp;

void ins(ll val) {
	ll a = *low.rbegin();
	if (a < val) {
		up.insert(val);
		sUp += val;
		if (up.size() > K / 2) {
			ll moving = *up.begin();
			low.insert(moving);
			sLow += moving;
			up.erase(up.find(moving));
			sUp -= moving;
		}
	} else {
		low.insert(val);
		sLow += val;
		if (low.size() > (K + 1) / 2) {
			ll moving = *low.rbegin();
			up.insert(*low.rbegin());
			sUp += moving;
			low.erase(low.find(*low.rbegin()));
			sLow -= moving;
		}
	}
}

void er(ll val) {
	if (up.find(val) != up.end()) up.erase(up.find(val)), sUp -= val;
	else low.erase(low.find(val)), sLow -= val;
	if (low.empty()) {
		ll moving = *up.begin();
		low.insert(*up.begin());
		sLow += moving;
		up.erase(up.find(*up.begin()));
		sUp -= moving;
	}
}

ll med() { return (K % 2 == 0) ? 0 : (*low.rbegin()); }

int main() {
	cin >> N >> K;
	for (ll i = 0; i < N; i++) cin >> arr[i];
	low.insert(arr[0]);
	sLow += arr[0];
	for (ll i = 1; i < K; i++) ins(arr[i]);
	cout << sUp - sLow + med();
	if (N != 1) cout << " ";
	for (ll i = K; i < N; i++) {
		if (K == 1) {
			ins(arr[i]);
			er(arr[i - K]);
		} else {
			er(arr[i - K]);
			ins(arr[i]);
		}
		cout << sUp - sLow + med();
		if (i != N - 1) cout << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
}
```
