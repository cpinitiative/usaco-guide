First, sort the people. This allows us to express the contribution of each team
as $(\text{Skill of last person}) - (\text{Skill of first person})$. Let $s_i$
denote the skill of the $i$-th person.

$dp[i][j][k] =$ The number of ways we can form teams from the first $i$ people
such that there are $j$ "unfinished" teams and the total penalty so far is $k$. If the $l$-th person is the least skilled in an unfinished team, we define its contribution to the penalty as $-s_l$. Similarly, finishing a team with person $r$ contributes $s_r$ to the penalty. These definitions follow directly from the previous observation that the contribution of a team is $s_r - s_l$.

There are 4 cases when we transition from $i - 1$ to $i$:

- We make a team consisting of only person $i$.
  - $dp[i - 1][j][k]$ transitions to the state $dp[i][j][k]$ (unfinished teams and penalty are not affected).
- We append person $i$ to an unfinished team.
  - This transitions to the state $dp[i][j][k]$ (again, unfinished teams and penalty are not affected). There are $j$ unfinished teams we can choose to extend, so $dp[i][j][k] \mathrel{+}= j \cdot dp[i - 1][j][k]$.
- We use person $i$ to "finish" an unfinished team.
  - This transitions to the state $dp[i][j - 1][k + s_i]$ (one less unfinished team, and we add to penalty as discussed above). There are again $j$ unfinished teams to choose from, so $dp[i][j - 1][k + s[i]] \mathrel{+}= j \cdot dp[i - 1][j][k]$.
- We start a new unfinished team with person $i$.
  - This transitions to the state $dp[i][j + 1][k - s[i]]$ (one more unfinished team, and we subtract from penalty as discussed above).

Two more things:

- $k$ in our DP array can be negative, so just add 5000 to each $k$; there can be at most $N/2 = 50$ unfinished intervals, and each of them contributes at most $-100$.
- $dp[i]$ depends only on $dp[i - 1]$, so we can drop the first dimension that
  we store (to save memory).

I believe that this is called the "open and close interval trick". See
[zscoder's blog post](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/47764) for more
information and problems.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const int M = 1e9 + 7;
const int K = 5e3;  // K is an offset to account for negatives

int main() {
	int n;
	int x;  // max penalty
	cin >> n >> x;
	vector<int> s(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cin >> s[i]; }
	sort(s.begin(), s.end());

	/*
	 * dp[N][N][X] -> dp[i][j][k] = first i people, j unfinished groups, k
	 * penalty for convenience, we 1-index dp array and 0-index person array so
	 * dp[i][j][k] lines up with s[i] (i.e. skill of person i + 1 = s[i]) notice
	 * we only need to store 2 rows!
	 */

	// the subarray we're currently at
	vector<vector<ll>> dp1(n + 1, vector<ll>(x + K + 1));
	// the next subarray (we'll fill this up using dp1)
	vector<vector<ll>> dp2(n + 1, vector<ll>(x + K + 1));

	dp1[0][K] = 1;  // dp[0][0][0] -> 0 people, 0 unfinished groups, 0 penalty
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j <= (n - i); j++) {  // at most n - i unfinished groups
			for (int k = 0; k <= x + K; k++) {
				if (!dp1[j][k]) { continue; }
				dp2[j][k] += dp1[j][k];  // i has their own group
				if (j && k + s[i] <= x + K) {
					dp2[j - 1][k + s[i]] += j * dp1[j][k];  // finish group
				}
				if (j + 1 <= n - (i + 1)) {
					dp2[j + 1][k - s[i]] +=
					    dp1[j][k];  // create new unfinished group
				}
				if (j <= n - (i + 1)) {
					dp2[j][k] += j * dp1[j][k];  // extend unfinished group
				}
			}
		}
		for (int j = 0; j <= (n - (i + 1)); j++) {
			for (int k = 0; k <= x + K; k++) {
				dp1[j][k] = dp2[j][k] % M;  // i + 1 becomes the new i
				dp2[j][k] = 0;
			}
		}
	}

	int ans = 0;
	for (int i = K; i <= x + K; i++) {
		ans += dp1[0][i];
		ans %= M;
	}

	cout << ans << endl;
}
