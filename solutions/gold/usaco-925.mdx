<Spoiler title = "Hint">

The graph is a forest, and we are only allowed to pick one path from each tree
to reach our total. This seems like knapsack!

The issue with directly writing a knapsack is that there is no bound on
how long we can make our path. Notice that all tracks and paths of length $\ge Y$
behave the same because they are already long enough. How can this simplify our DP?

<Spoiler title = "Explanation">

The key observation to make is that we can compress all paths and tracks of
length $\ge Y$ because they all are treated the same, in that they result in a
track of sufficient length.

For each tree, we can compress all the paths into $(length, frequency)$ pairs.
Then, we can knapsack as usual. However, note that because we are compressing
all paths of length $\ge Y$, we need to explicitly store the sum of the path
lengths as well.

Our DP state would keep track of both the sum of the path lengths and
the number of such paths, for each possible length of our path.

Let $k$ be the number of trees in our forest. To account for the possible ways
of ordering our paths, we need to multiply our initial sum of paths by
$2^{k} * k!$. However, cyclic rotations and reversed paths are considered
to be the same, so we divide by $2k$: $2^{k - 1} * (k - 1)!$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NY^{\frac{3}{2}})$
