## TL;DR

Draw lines between circles and to borders, and use DSU to answer queries
offline.

## Intuition

In this problem, we're given a park with circles of differing radii and asked
whether some circle can move from a corner of the park to another corner. Upon
first glance, this task seems quite challenging and probably involves some
not-so-fun geometry. However, the final solution turns out to be quite nice, and
not too hard to implement either.

Let's call the circle you are moving around between exits $x$. We claim that $x$
can move between two circles $a$ and $b$ as long as
$dist(a, b) - a_r - b_r \leq x_r$, where $x_r$ denotes the radius of $x$, $a_r$
and $b_r$ denote the radius of $a$ and $b$ and $dist(a, b)$ denotes the distance
between the centers of $a$ and $b$. Also, let's add horizontal and vertical line
segments from each border of the park to each circle with the distance between
them as well.

Finally, observe that you can go from exit $e_1$ to exit $e_2$ as long as there
isn't some chain of line segments with weight $\leq x_r$ that completely blocks
off the path between exits. For example, you can go from the top-right exit to
the bottom-left exit as long as there isn't a chain of line segments from the
top border to the bottom, top to right, bottom to left, or left to right.

## Creating a Graph

Now, you have some circles with weights between each other. Let's transform each
of the line segments we defined before into an edge, and each circle and border
into a node, creating $n ^ 2 + 4n$ edges overall and $n + 4$ nodes.

The problem of checking whether we can go between two exits now becomes
checking, for some $r$, whether edges with weight $\leq r$ connect certain
borders (this involves some casework).

## Offline Queries and DSU

To efficently answer queries of whether two borders are connected, let's process
them in order of increasing $x_r$ and store a DSU. Now, we can add edges one by
one as long as their weight $\leq x_r$, and then check connectivity between the
border nodes.

<Warning>
	When computing distance between two circles, make sure to subtract the radius
	of both. We want the distance between the borders, not the centers.
