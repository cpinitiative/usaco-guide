<Spoiler title = "Hint 1">

After precalculating all the distances from the capital, consider two types of
edges: edges that go from lower to higher distance nodes from the capital, and
edges that go from higher to lower (or equal) distance nodes. Try writing a
DP recurrence for each type of edge.

<Spoiler title = "Hint 2">

How should we order the nodes so that each node's relevant children have their
DP values computed before it?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title = "Answer to Hint 2">

We need to process the nodes in descending order of distance from the capital.

<Spoiler title = "Explanation">

Let $dist$ store the distances from the capital for each node, and $dp$ store the
closest that each node can get to the capital. For a given node, the DP relation is:

1. $dp[u] = min(dp[u], dp[v])$, if $dist[u] < dist[v]$.
2. $dp[u] = min(dp[u], dist[v])$, if $dist[u] \ge dist[v]$.

Because the only time the value of $dp[u]$ depends on its children is when
$dist[u] < dist[v]$, we have to process the nodes in descending order of distance
from the capital.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int test_num;
	cin >> test_num;
	for (int tc = 0; tc < test_num; tc++) {
		int n, m;
		cin >> n >> m;
		vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			int u, v;
			cin >> u >> v;
			u--, v--;
			adj[u].push_back(v);
		}

		// calculate distance from the capital
		vector<int> capital_dist(n, -1);
		queue<array<int, 2>> q;
		q.push({0, 0});
		while (!q.empty()) {
			auto [u, t] = q.front();
			q.pop();
			if (capital_dist[u] != -1) { continue; }
			capital_dist[u] = t;
			for (int v : adj[u]) {
				if (capital_dist[v] == -1) { q.push({v, t + 1}); }
			}
		}

		// order the nodes by distance from capital
		vector<int> order(n);
		iota(begin(order), end(order), 0);
		sort(begin(order), end(order),
		     [&](int i, int j) { return capital_dist[i] > capital_dist[j]; });

		// calculate the DP
		vector<int> min_dist = capital_dist;
		for (int node1 : order) {
			for (int node2 : adj[node1]) {
				if (capital_dist[node1] < capital_dist[node2]) {
					min_dist[node1] = min(min_dist[node1], min_dist[node2]);
				} else {
					min_dist[node1] = min(min_dist[node1], capital_dist[node2]);
				}
			}
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { cout << min_dist[i] << " \n"[i == n - 1]; }
	}
}
