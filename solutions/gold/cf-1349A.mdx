## Solution: Prime Factorization

For each prime, the second-to-lowest exponent of the prime that occurs in any of
the numbers in the input is the exponent of this prime that will appear in the
final answer.

Here's a short solution that accomplishes this without explicitly computing any
prime factorizations!

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

ll a, b;
// a stores minimum exponents (gcd of all numbers seen so far)
// b stores second minimum exponents
int n;

void red() {  // restore invariant mentioned above
	ll g = __gcd(a, b);
	tie(a, b) = make_pair(g, a / g * b);  // a/g*b = lcm(a,b)
}

int main() {
	cin >> n >> a >> b;
	red();
	for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
		ll x;
		cin >> x;
		b = __gcd(b, x);
		red();
	}
	cout << b << endl;
}
```

		int N = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int[] nums = new int[N];

		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			nums[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		}

		long gcd = gcd(nums[0], nums[1]);
		long ret = nums[0] / gcd * nums[1];
		for (int i = 2; i < N; gcd = gcd(gcd, nums[i]), i++) {
			ret = gcd(ret, lcm(nums[i], gcd));
		}
		System.out.println(ret);
	}

	static long lcm(long a, long b) { return a / gcd(a, b) * b; }

	static long gcd(long a, long b) { return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); }
}
```

If it's hard to understand what exactly this code is doing at first glance, a
good first step is to simulating the code in the case where each $a_i$ is a
power of the same prime (say, $2^k$). If the algorithm works for this case, then
it will also work in the general case since the contributions of different
primes are computed independently and multiplied together.

<!-- the GCD function is [multiplicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_function). -->

Here's another way of thinking about this:

For a fixed $j$,

$$
\gcd_{0\le i<j}\left[\text{lcm}(a_i,a_j)\right]=\text{lcm}(a_j,\gcd_{0\le i<j}(a_i)),
$$

and we can update $\gcd_{0\le i<j}(a_i)$ when $j$ increases by one. Taking the
GCD of the results for each $j$ gives the answer.
