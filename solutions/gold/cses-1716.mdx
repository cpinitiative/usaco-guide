<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

This might sound odd, but try representing a distribution by putting all the children and apples in a single line.

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

From the first hint, you should have noticed that each distribution can be represented by having each child own an interval of the apples.
Now it remains to count how many ways you can put the children between the apples.

## Explanation

To get a more illustrative idea of the given problem, consider $n + m - 1$ white
balls in a row. Of those $n + m - 1$ white balls, $m - 1$ are chosen to be
colored black as separators, which gives us exactly $m$ segments of (possibly
zero) white balls. There are

$$
\binom{n + m - 1}{m - 1}
$$

ways to choose the balls to color black.

The ways to color $m - 1$ balls black corresponds to the ways to distribute
those $n$ apples to $m$ children, since the number of white balls in a segment
corresponds to the number of apples given to a child.

<Info title="Stars and bars">

The given problem is equivalent to finding the number of solutions for the
equation

$$
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = m.
$$

The method used in this problem is called
[Stars and bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)).

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAXN = 2e6;

vector<ll> fac(MAXN, 1);
vector<ll> inv(MAXN, 1);

ll binpow(ll x, ll n, ll m) {
	x %= m;
	ll res = 1;
	while (n > 0) {
		if (n % 2 == 1) { res = res * x % m; }
		x = x * x % m;
		n /= 2;
	}
	return res;
}

ll binom(int n, int k) { return fac[n] * inv[k] % MOD * inv[n - k] % MOD; }

int main() {
	for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) { fac[i] = i * fac[i - 1] % MOD; }

	inv[MAXN - 1] = binpow(fac[MAXN - 1], MOD - 2, MOD);
	for (int i = MAXN - 2; i > 0; i--) { inv[i] = (i + 1) * inv[i + 1] % MOD; }

	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;

	cout << binom(n + m - 1, n - 1) << endl;
}
```
