## General graph -> Tree

General graphs are inconvenient - let's try to turn this graph into a tree!

Run Dijkstra's algorithm from node $A$ to every other node and construct the
"shortest path tree" from this (i.e. the tree made of the union of the shortest
paths from node $A$ to each other node). Make sure to force the lucky path given
in the input to be in this tree!

Why is this useful? In this case, we get some cool properties from removing
edges on the lucky path.

## What happens when we remove an edge?

When we remove an edge on the lucky path, the tree splits into two smaller
trees - one containing $A$; one containing $B$.

This means the shortest path $A \rightarrow B$ must be of the form
$A \rightarrow u \rightarrow v \rightarrow B$ where $u$ and $v$ are two nodes
joined by an edge and $u$ is in $A$'s tree while $v$ is in $B$'s tree.

Why is this true?

Firstly, any vertex is still connected to either $A$ via its shortest path tree
or $B$ via its shortest path tree after a single edge on the shortest path is
removed.

Secondly, we must "jump" from one subtree to the other at some point, so the new
shortest paths must have two nodes in separate subtrees joined by an edge.

## Updating the shortest paths

An important observation is that if you keep moving up from a node to its
parent, you'll eventually reach a node on the lucky path. For node $v$, let this
node on the lucky path be $P_v$. Since $N$ is so small, we can just naively find
$P_v$ for each $v$.

Since $u$ and $v$ must be in separate subtrees, the path
$A \rightarrow u \rightarrow v \rightarrow B$ is only a candidate for the
shortest path after removing an edge if that edge lies between $P_u$ and $P_v$.

We must thus only update the shortest paths after removing an edge for the edges
between $P_u$ and $P_v$ for each edge $(u, v)$.

Again, we can just naively update these shortest paths.

The final complexity of this algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(MN + M \log N)$

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
	int u, v;
	ll c;
} edges[200000];

bool operator<(Edge a, Edge b) {
	if (a.c == b.c) {
		if (a.u == b.u) return a.v < b.v;
		return a.u < b.u;
	}
	return a.c < b.c;
}

vector<pair<int, ll>> graph[2001];
vector<int> sp_tree[2001];
int sp[2001], lca[2001];
ll from_a[2001], from_b[2001], ans[2001];
int par[2001], depth[2001];

void dijkstra(int source, ll *dist) {
	priority_queue<tuple<ll, int, int>> pq;
	pq.push({-1, source, 0});
	while (pq.size()) {
		int curr, parent;
		ll cost;
		tie(cost, curr, parent) = pq.top();
		pq.pop();
		if (!dist[curr]) {
			par[curr] = parent;
			dist[curr] = -cost;
			for (pair<int, ll> i : graph[curr])
				pq.push({cost - i.second, i.first, curr});
		}
	}
}

void dfs(int node) {
	for (int i : sp_tree[node]) {
		depth[i] = depth[node] + 1;
		dfs(i);
	}
}

int find_lca(int a, int b) {
	while (depth[a] > depth[b]) a = par[b];
	while (depth[b] > depth[a]) b = par[b];
	while (a != b) a = par[a], b = par[b];
	return a;
}

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);
	int n, m, a, b, k;
	cin >> n >> m >> a >> b;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> edges[i].u >> edges[i].v >> edges[i].c;
		edges[i + m] = {edges[i].v, edges[i].u, edges[i].c};
		graph[edges[i].u].push_back({edges[i].v, edges[i].c});
		graph[edges[i].v].push_back({edges[i].u, edges[i].c});
	}

	dijkstra(b, from_b);
	dijkstra(a, from_a);

	cin >> k;
	for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
		cin >> sp[i];
		if (i) par[sp[i]] = sp[i - 1];
	}

	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		if (par[i]) sp_tree[par[i]].push_back(i);
	dfs(a);
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) lca[i] = find_lca(i, b);

	memset(ans, 0x3f, sizeof(ans));
	for (int i = 0; i < 2 * m; i++) {
		if (par[edges[i].u] == edges[i].v || par[edges[i].v] == edges[i].u)
			continue;
		int x = find(sp, sp + k, lca[edges[i].u]) - sp;
		int y = find(sp, sp + k, lca[edges[i].v]) - sp;
		for (int j = x; j < y; j++)
			ans[j] = min(ans[j], from_a[edges[i].u] + from_b[edges[i].v] +
			                         edges[i].c - 2);
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++)
		cout << (ans[i] == 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f ? -1 : ans[i]) << '\n';
	return 0;
}
