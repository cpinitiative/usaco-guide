[Official Analysis (Java)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_checklist_gold_dec16.html)

Note that at any single point in time Farmer John will be at either a Holstein or a Guernsey, and will have the choice to either go to the next Holstein or Guernsey.

This suggests a DP. Let $\texttt{dp}_{i,j}$ represent the minimum cumulative distance for Farmer John to visit the first $i$ Holsteins and the first $j$ Guernseys.
<Asterisk>We'll have to add an extra dimension when we're actually implementing the problem to account for which one Farmer John is currently at.</Asterisk>

Then, Farmer John can either go to the next Holstein or the next Guernsey.

$\texttt{dp}_{i, j} = \min(\texttt{dp}_{i - 1,j}, \texttt{dp}_{i,j - 1})$


## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(H \cdot G)$
