Generate the complement of the given graph.

The complement or inverse of a graph G is a graph H
such that two distinct vertices of H are adjacent if and only if
they are **not** adjacent in G.

To generate the complement of a graph,
we'll fill in all the missing edges required to form a complete graph,
and remove all the previously existing edges.

<Spoiler title="Hint 3">

If you're stuck on DP when $ N \leq 20 $,

Let the DP array store **the set of points** in the subgraph
that meet specific conditions.

<Spoiler title="Hint 4">

Divide the original graph into two parts, do DP on each of them, and then merge.

<Spoiler title="Explanation">

#### Bitmask DP

First, we can alter the problem
by building the complement graph of the original graph.

This turns it into a maximum clique problem (MCP).

Clique can be seen as a complete graph.

It's not a good idea to only store the number of points in the answer graph because it'll be hard to transfer.

Let the DP array store the set of points within the maximum clique in
the subgraph.

Then, each element in the DP array represents a bitmask.

Let $\texttt{dp}[S]$ to represent **any** valid maximum clique solution in
subgraph $S$.

Consider a point $k$ in $S$.

If this point is in the maximum clique,

$$
\texttt{dp}[S] = \texttt{dp}[E_k\cap S] \cup \{k\}
$$

(where $E_k$ represents the neighbour set of $k$)

otherwise

$$
\texttt{dp}[S] =\texttt{dp} [S \backslash {k}]

$$

Take the maximum one.

$$
\texttt{dp}[S] = \max\{ \texttt{dp}[E_k\cap S] \cup \{k\} , \texttt{dp} [S \backslash {k}] \}
$$

**Notice this** $\max$ **is compared by popcount in the program.**

But the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(2 ^ n)$ or $\mathcal{O}(2 ^ n \cdot n)$,
so we'll need to optimize it further.

#### Meet-in-the-middle

Divide the original graph into two parts, do DP on each part, then merge:

Given two parts $S1$ and $S2$, loop through **every subgraph** of $S1$,

Then, find a subgraph of $S2$ that has direct edges with **all of the points** in the subgraph of $S1$ that we're looping through.

Lastly, we'll union the two subgraphs.

Finding this subgraph of $S2$ can also be solved with Bitmask DP.

Time Complexity is $\mathcal{O}(2^{\frac N2})$.
