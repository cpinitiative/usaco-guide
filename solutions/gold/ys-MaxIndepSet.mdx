<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

40 is just a bit too big for us to use bitmask DP.
Could there be a way to reduce the amount of states we could use?

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Say we split the graph in two halves arbitrarily and solved the problem on each half.
How could we merge the halves efficiently?

<Spoiler title="Hint 3">

Try having the graph subsets keep track of *all* possible cliques within it, not just whether
the subset itself is a clique or not.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

## Explanation

To make things a bit easier to think about, let's consider the complement of the graph instead.
Then it remains to find the maximum [clique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory))
in the graph instead of the maximum set.
Note that this doesn't change anything about the actual problem- this is just to simplify things a little.

First, let's split the graph in two as previously stated in the hints.
For all node subsets of each half, we then calculate:
1. Whether the subset *itself* is a clique
2. The maximum clique that is a subset of the node subset

Then, when merging the halves, we iterate through all cliques of the first half of the graph
and check which nodes in the other half are connected to all nodes in the first clique.
With these nodes in the other half, we can then look at the maximum clique we previously calculated
and add them to the clique in the first half.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(2^{\frac N2})$

```cpp
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;
using ll = long long;

/** @return whether n has a bit set at the position given */
bool bit_set(const ll &n, int pos) { return n & (1LL << pos); }

/** @return the number given with more bits set */
ll more_bits(const ll &a, const ll &b) {
	return __builtin_popcountll(a) > __builtin_popcountll(b) ? a : b;
}

/** @return a pair with the two things our subsets keep track of */
std::pair<vector<bool>, vector<ll>> max_cliques(const vector<ll> &adj) {
	int sz = adj.size();  // just a shorthand

	// This keeps track of whether subsets are cliques themselves
	vector<bool> valid(1 << sz);
	valid[0] = true;
	for (int n1 = 0; n1 < sz; n1++) {
		valid[1 << n1] = true;
		for (int n2 = n1 + 1; n2 < sz; n2++) {
			valid[(1 << n1) + (1 << n2)] = adj[n1] & (1 << n2);
		}
	}

	for (int ss = 1; ss < (1 << sz); ss++) {
		if (__builtin_popcountll(ss) <= 2) { continue; }
		valid[ss] = true;
		for (int prev = 0; prev < sz; prev++) {
			if (bit_set(ss, prev) && !valid[ss & ~(1 << prev)]) {
				valid[ss] = false;
				break;
			}
		}
	}

	// And this contains a max-size clique within each subset
	vector<ll> largest(1 << sz);
	for (int ss = 0; ss < (1 << sz); ss++) {
		if (valid[ss]) {
			largest[ss] = ss;
			continue;
		}
		for (int prev = 0; prev < sz; prev++) {
			if (bit_set(ss, prev)) {
				largest[ss] =
				    more_bits(largest[ss], largest[ss & ~(1 << prev)]);
			}
		}
	}

	return {valid, largest};
}

int main() {
	int node_num;
	int edge_num;
	std::cin >> node_num >> edge_num;

	vector<ll> adj(node_num, (1LL << node_num) - 1);
	for (int e = 0; e < edge_num; e++) {
		int n1, n2;
		std::cin >> n1 >> n2;
		adj[n1] &= ~(1LL << n2);
		adj[n2] &= ~(1LL << n1);
	}

	// Calculate the relevant arrays for each half
	int half1 = node_num / 2;
	vector<ll> half1_adj(half1);
	for (int n = 0; n < half1; n++) {
		half1_adj[n] = adj[n] & ((1 << half1) - 1);
	}
	auto [valid1, largest1] = max_cliques(half1_adj);

	int half2 = node_num - half1;
	vector<ll> half2_adj(half2);
	for (int n = 0; n < half2; n++) { half2_adj[n] = adj[half1 + n] >> half1; }
	auto [valid2, largest2] = max_cliques(half2_adj);

	ll best_ss = 0;
	// Iterate through all cliques in the first half
	for (int ss1 = 0; ss1 < (1 << half1); ss1++) {
		if (!valid1[ss1]) { continue; }
		// Get all nodes in the second half connected to all nodes in the first
		ll ss2 = (1 << half2) - 1;
		for (int n = 0; n < half1; n++) {
			if (bit_set(ss1, n)) { ss2 &= adj[n] >> half1; }
		}

		// And calculate the final answer for this current clique
		best_ss = more_bits(best_ss, largest1[ss1] + (largest2[ss2] << half1));
	}

	cout << __builtin_popcountll(best_ss) << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < node_num; i++) {
		if (bit_set(best_ss, i)) {
			cout << i << ' ';  // Trailing whitespace doesn't matter
		}
	}
}
