## Explanation

A naive method would be to iterate through each pair of clones and calculate the number
of positions with different genomes in near $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time.
This seems to be virtually impossible, so we should probably try a different method.

What if we somehow managed to check each clone against all the other clones at the same time?
This way we could iterate through each character and maintain an $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time complexity.

We can precalculate for each position the number of `A`s, `T`s, `C`s, and `G`s that all the clones have.
Then, when checking a single subject, we see how many of the other genomes have been found at that position
and sum up all the differences at the end.

However, this brings up another problem: there's no way to check which genome belongs to which clone!
If our subject differs from one clone by $k-1$ positions and from another clone by $k+1$ positions, our
current algorithm would have no idea that they aren't the actual villain, as the total difference of the
two is still $2k$, the same as if the subject differed from both by $k$ positions.

To address this problem, we can assign each clone a random weight $R_i$.
Then, instead of just calculating the *number* of clones with a certain genome at a certain position,
we calculate the sum of the weights of these clones.
This allows us to differentiate between a genome difference due to clone $A$ versus a genome difference due to clone $B$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <random>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

const vector<char> DNA{'A', 'T', 'C', 'G'};

int main() {
	int dna_num, seq_len;
	int diff_num;
	std::cin >> dna_num >> seq_len >> diff_num;

	vector<vector<char>> dna(dna_num, vector<char>(seq_len));
	for (int d = 0; d < dna_num; d++) {
		for (int i = 0; i < seq_len; i++) { std::cin >> dna[d][i]; }
	}

	// generate random 32-bit weights for each of the clones
	std::random_device rd;
	std::mt19937 gen(42069);
	std::uniform_int_distribution<> distr(1, INT32_MAX);
	vector<long long> weights(dna_num);
	for (int d = 0; d < dna_num; d++) { weights[d] = distr(gen); }
	// the sum of all the clones' weights
	long long weight_sum = std::accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0LL);

	/*
	 * dna_eq[d][j] = the sum of all the weights of the clones
	 * who have their jth position equal to DNA[d]
	 */
	vector<vector<long long>> dna_eq(DNA.size(), vector<long long>(seq_len));
	for (int d = 0; d < DNA.size(); d++) {
		for (int i = 0; i < dna_num; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < seq_len; j++) {
				dna_eq[d][j] += (dna[i][j] == DNA[d]) * weights[i];
			}
		}
	}

	for (int d = 0; d < dna_num; d++) {
		long long missed_amt = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < DNA.size(); i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < seq_len; j++) {
				if (dna[d][j] == DNA[i]) {
					/*
					 * get all the clones who DON'T share the same
					 * genome at this position and get the sum of their weights
					 */
					missed_amt += weight_sum - dna_eq[i][j];
				}
			}
		}

		// check if this lines up with the requirements of the problem
		if (missed_amt == (weight_sum - weights[d]) * diff_num) {
			cout << (d + 1) << endl;
			break;
		}
	}
}
