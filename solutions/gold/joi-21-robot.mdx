**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O((N + M) \log N)$

**Lemma:** We can always recolour an edge $(u, v)$ so that its colour is
different from those of the other edges incident to $u$ and $v$.

**Proof:** If we take away $(u, v)$, then there are at most $M - 1$ edges
incident to $u$ and $v$. Since there are $M$ colours in total, there must exist
some colour such that none of those edges have it (by the pigeonhole principle).
Therefore, we can simply recolour $(u, v)$ to that colour.

This means we can define the cost to traverse an edge as:

$$
\min(\text{Cost to recolour it}, \text{Cost to recolour same-coloured neighbours})
$$

It may be tempting to use Dijkstra's algorithm at this point, but that will
unfortunately result in a wrong answer. Consider the following:

- The robot goes on the path $u \rightarrow v \rightarrow w$.
- $(u, v)$ and $(v, w)$ have the same colour.
- It's optimal to recolour $(u, v)$ when going $u \rightarrow v$, but it's
  optimal to recolour the same-coloured neighbours of $(v, w)$ when going
  $v \rightarrow w$.

In this case, using Dijkstra's algorithm naively will count the cost to recolour
$(u, v)$ twice in our answer!

To amend this, let's define two DP arrays instead of just one:

- $\texttt{dp1}[i]$ is the minimum cost to get to node $i$.
- $\texttt{dp2}[i][c]$ is the minimum cost to get to node $i$ if:
  - The robot just traversed a $c$-coloured edge to get to node $i$.
  - We're meant to have recoloured that edge, but haven't yet.
  - The robot will definitely leave node $i$ via another $c$-coloured edge and
    we will recolour all of its same-coloured neighbours.

We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm and some casework to solve this problem in
amortized $\mathcal O((N + M) \log N)$ time.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

const ll INF = 1e18;

struct Edge {
	int to, c;
	ll p;
};

map<int, vector<Edge>> graph[100001];
ll dp[100001];
map<int, ll> dp2[100001], psum[100001];

int main() {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;
	for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
		int u, v, c;
		ll p;
		cin >> u >> v >> c >> p;
		graph[u][c].push_back({v, c, p});
		graph[v][c].push_back({u, c, p});
		psum[u][c] += p;
		psum[v][c] += p;
	}

	memset(dp, 0x3f, sizeof dp);
	dp[1] = 0;
	priority_queue<tuple<ll, int, int>> pq;
	pq.push({0, 1, 0});
	while (pq.size()) {
		ll cost;
		int node, c;
		tie(cost, node, c) = pq.top();
		pq.pop();

		if (c) {
			if (dp2[node][c] != -cost) continue;
			for (Edge i : graph[node][c]) {
				// We can't flip i in this case
				ll case1 = psum[node][c] - i.p;
				if (case1 - cost < dp[i.to]) {
					dp[i.to] = case1 - cost;
					pq.push({-dp[i.to], i.to, 0});
				}
			}
		} else {
			if (dp[node] != -cost) continue;
			for (auto &i : graph[node]) {
				for (Edge j : i.second) {
					// Case 1: We don't flip j
					ll case1 = psum[node][j.c] - j.p - cost;
					if (case1 < dp[j.to]) {
						dp[j.to] = case1;
						pq.push({-dp[j.to], j.to, 0});
					}
					// Case 2: We flip j but not another edge of the same colour
					ll case2 = j.p - cost;
					if (case2 < dp[j.to]) {
						dp[j.to] = case2;
						pq.push({-dp[j.to], j.to, 0});
					}
					// Case 3: We flip j and another edge of the same colour
					ll case3 = -cost;
					if (!dp2[j.to].count(j.c) || case3 < dp2[j.to][j.c]) {
						dp2[j.to][j.c] = case3;
						pq.push({-dp2[j.to][j.c], j.to, j.c});
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	cout << (dp[n] > INF ? -1 : dp[n]);
	return 0;
}
