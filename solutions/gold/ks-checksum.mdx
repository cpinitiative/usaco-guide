## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$

Since the official analysis is well-documented and covers the problem in its
entirety, read that first. The following notes clarify a few details of the
implementation.

- Firstly, note that the number of rows and columns is equivalent to $2N$,
  because the matrix is square. Therefore, when constructing our graph, we can
  simply add $N$ to distinguish row $i$ from column $j$.

> Of course, the problem of finding a minimum weight cycle breaking edge set is
> equivalent to the well known problem of finding a maximum weight spanning
> forest of $G$, except that we would build the complement set of edges to keep
> rather than the set of edges to remove.

- Notice that the edges that we should remove - which are highlighted in the
  diagram in red - are equivalent to any edges that are not included in the
  maximum spanning tree of graph $G$. Therefore, our answer is equivalent to the
  difference between the total sum of all the edges and the those that are in
  the maximum spanning tree.
