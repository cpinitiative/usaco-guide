## Explanation

Like [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://usaco.guide/gold/mst#kruskals), we generate
our MST by adding edges greedily. Except the edges between any two adjacent
elements in the array which cost $p$, an edge only exists between $i$ and $j$ if
the greatest common divisor of all elements in $[i, j]$ equals the minimum of
the range $[i, j]$.

As the cost of these edges is the minimum element of the range, let's iterate
through all elements of the array in ascending order. This way, we guarantee
that we always add edges of minimum cost. Let the current element be $a[k]$.
There is an edge between $k$ and $k - 1$ if $a[k]$ divides $a[k - 1]$. In that
case, we can go further to $a[k - 2]$ and so on until $a[k]$ no longer divides
$a[k - i]$, or when the two elements are connected already. We apply the same
operation in the other direction ($k + 1$, ...).

We stop the iteration when the cost of the edge (= the value of the element) is
greater than $p$. For all components that are not connected yet, we can simply
connect them with cost $p$. If we count the number of edges $c$ already added,
and since a MST has $N - 1$ edges, we can add $p \cdot (N - 1 - c)$ to the
answer.

Since the connected components are always a segment in the array, we only have
to consider $\mathcal{O}(N)$ edges.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

/** Solves a single test case. */
void solve() {
	int n, p;
	cin >> n >> p;
	vector<int> arr(n);
	vector<int> indices(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> arr[i];
		indices[i] = i;
	}

	// i < j implies arr[indices[i]] <= arr[indices[j]]
	sort(indices.begin(), indices.end(),
	     [&](const int i, const int j) { return arr[i] < arr[j]; });

	ll ans = 0;
	int edges_remaining = n - 1;
	// is_connected[i] == true if there is an edge between i and i+1
	vector<bool> is_connected(n, false);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int j = indices[i];
		int val = arr[j];
		/*
		 * if the edge costs more than p, then connect the rest with edges of
		 * type 2 which cost p
		 */
		if (val >= p) { break; }

		// try to add an edge (j, indices[i]) to the left
		while (j > 0 && !is_connected[j - 1] && arr[j - 1] % val == 0) {
			edges_remaining--;
			ans += val;
			is_connected[j - 1] = true;
			j--;
		}

		// try to add an edge (indices[i], j) to the right
		j = indices[i];
		while (j < n - 1 && !is_connected[j] && arr[j + 1] % val == 0) {
			edges_remaining--;
			ans += val;
			is_connected[j] = true;
			j++;
		}
	}

	// the edges that still have to be added have the cost p
	ans += (ll)edges_remaining * p;

	cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
	int test_num;
	cin >> test_num;
	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) { solve(); }
}
```
