## Explanation

### Observation

We can think of the output slots as positions on the number line.
Consider a wagon that starts moving at time $0$. Then, that wagon can catch a
candy $c_i$ $(s_i, t_i)$ if its position at time $0$ is within the range
$[s_i - t_i, s_i + t_i]$. Let's define this range as the **range of acceptable
wagon positions** for $c_i$ at time $0$. With every passing second, this range
is reduced by $1$ unit to the left and to the right of $s_i$.
Generally, the range of acceptable wagon positions for $c_i$ at time $t$
(where $t \leq t_i$) is:
$$
[s_i - (t_i - t), s_i + (t_i - t)]
$$
At time $t_i$ this range has been shrunk to a single point, $s_i$.

A wagon can catch a candy $c_j$ $(s_j, t_j)$ before $c_i$, if the range of
acceptable wagon positions for $i$ at time $t_j$ includes $s_j$, (since the
wagon will be at $s_j$ to catch $j$). However, at time $t_j$ the range for
acceptable wagon positions of $c_i$ will have been reduced to
$$
[s_i - (t_i - t_j), s_i + (t_i - t_j)]
$$

But $s_j$ needs to be inside this range, therefore:
$$
s_i - (t_i - t_j) \leq s_j \text{ and } s_j \leq s_i + (t_i - t_j) \iff
$$
$$
s_i - t_i \leq s_j - t_j \text{ and } s_j + t_j \leq s_i + t_i
$$

This is equivalent to saying that the range of acceptable wagon positions of
$c_j$ is fully contained within the range of $c_i$.

We have therefore concluded that two candies can be caught by the same wagon
if (and only if) their ranges of acceptable wagon positions are nested.

### Finding the minimum number of wagons

We can think of each candy as its range of acceptable wagon positions at time
0 $[s - t, s + t]$ (note that each candy corresponds to a unique range and vice
versa). We can conclude that a wagon can catch a sequence of candies
$c_1, c_2, ..., c_k$, if they form a sequence of nested ranges. It follows that
the minimum number of wagons needed is the longest sequence of non-nested
ranges.

Two ranges $[l_1, r_1]$, $[l_2, r_2]$ that are not nested adhere to:
$$l_1 < l_2 \implies r_1 < r_2$$.

If we sort the candies by the left endpoint of their ranges such that
$$
l_1 \leq l_2 \leq ... \leq l_n
$$
then a sequence of non-nested ranges would correspond to an increasing
sequence of right endpoints. Therefore, the minimum number of required wagons
would correspond to the length of the longest increasing sequence of right
endpoints.

### Assigning the candies to wagons

By following the binary search algorithm described in
[the LIS module](/gold/lis), we can assign the candies with the same LIS length
to the same wagon. The ranges that have the same LIS length cannot be nested.
If they were, we could use the inside range to increase the LIS of the outside
one by 1.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

<Warning>
Watch out for the case $l_i = l_j$, in which case we must sort by decreasing
right endpoint to ensure they would not be counted as non-nested ranges.

	sort(candies.begin(), candies.end(), [](const pi &a, const pi &b) -> bool {
		return (a.first == b.first ? a.second > b.second : a.first < b.first);
	});

	vector<int> lis(n + 1, INT_MAX);
	lis[0] = 0;
	vector<vector<pi>> candies_caught(n + 1);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int r_point = candies[i].second;

		int l = 0;  // Condition: lis[l] < r_point
		int r = n;  // Condition: lis[r] >= r_point
		while (r > l + 1) {
			int mid = (l + r) / 2;
			if (lis[mid] < r_point) {
				l = mid;
			} else {
				r = mid;

		}
		lis[l + 1] = r_point;
		// Candies with the same lis length can be caught by the same wagon
		candies_caught[l + 1].push_back(candies[i]);

	cout << ans << "\n";
