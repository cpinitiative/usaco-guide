## Intuition

In this problem, we're asked to play a game where players take turns claiming
unclaimed elements in a circular array that are adjacent to one of their
previously claimed elements (or any unclaimed element on their first turns).
Both players try to maximize the sum of values of their chosen elements.

After playing around with the game, we can make some important observations.

### Observation 1

<Info title = "Observation">

At the end of the game, the first player will control a subarray (a contiguous
subsequence) of the circular array of length exactly
$\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$, and the second player will control the
remaining elements.

</Info>

Since each player can only choose an element not adjacent to any other element
once (the first move), the elements each player claims must form a subarray.
Also, notice that any move made by either player will increase the length of the
subarray they control by one, and both players will always have a valid move.
Therefore, because the first player moves first, the subarray they control will
be of length $\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$.

### Observation 2

<Info title = "Observation">

For some first move made by the first player claiming index $x$, the second
player can always force the first player to control any subarray of length
$\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$ containing $x$.

</Info>

Consider the following strategy: for some move by the first player extending to
the left or right, make the opposite move.

Using this strategy, the second player can force the first player to control any
subarray of length $\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$ containing the first
players first move depending on the second players first move.

<!-- Better proof? idk I kinda proof by AC'd -->

## Computing the Solution

Using these observations, the answer equals:

$$
\max_{1 \leq x \leq n}\min_{v \in S_x}v
$$

where $S_x$ represents a set of sums for all subarrays of length
$\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$ containing $x$ in the circular array,
$\texttt{c}$.

### Transforming the Circular Array

First, to deal with the circular aspect of the array, let's concatenate it onto
itself to create an array of length $2n$ and call it $\texttt{a}$. Now, we only
need to compute subarrays on a linear array, where
$S_x = S'_x \cup S'_{x + n} (1 \leq x \leq n)$ where $S'_x$ represents the set
of subarrays containing $x$ in $\texttt{a}$.

### Using A Sorted Set

If we iterate over $x$ $(1 \leq x \leq 2n)$ in $\texttt{a}$, then we can store
the running sorted set $S'_x$ and use it to update $S_{x \bmod n}$. For
$x \geq 0$, add the sum over the subarray
$[x, x + \left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil - 1]$ to $S'x$ (you can compute
this using prefix sums). Additionally, if
$x \geq \left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$, remove the sum over
$[x - \left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil + 1, x]$. Then, we can compute the
minimum value of $S'x$ for some $x$ by querying for the smallest value in the
sorted set.

<Warning>

Make sure to use a `std::multiset` because there can be duplicate sums.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define rsz resize
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

int main(){
	ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);
	int n; cin >> n;
	vi a(2 * n + 1);
	a[0] = 0;
	multiset<int> vals;
	int SZ = (n + 1) / 2;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		cin >> a[i];
		a[n + i] = a[i];
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * n; i++) {
		a[i] += a[i - 1];
	}
	int ans = 0;
	vi ret(n + 1, INT_MAX);
	for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * n; i++) {
		if (i + SZ - 1 <= 2 * n) {
			vals.insert(a[i + SZ - 1] - a[i - 1]);
		}
		if (i > SZ) {
			vals.erase(vals.find(a[i - 1] - a[i - 1 - SZ]));
		}
		int prev = ((i - 1) % n) + 1;
		ret[prev] = min(ret[prev], *vals.begin());
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		ans = max(ans, ret[i]);
	}
	cout << ans << '\n';
}
```
