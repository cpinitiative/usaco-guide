## Solution ($O(N\sqrt N)$)

See [Eric Zhang's comment](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57170?#comment-410179).

## Alternate (Fake) Solution

First write some $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ DP that is somehow fast enough to
pass test cases 1-6.

This won't work for test cases 7-11, but these test cases are quite special!

<Spoiler title="How So?">

In these test cases the trees have at most 20 leaves. Therefore it suffices to
compress tree edges (repeatedly remove vertices of degree 2) and run the same
solution.
