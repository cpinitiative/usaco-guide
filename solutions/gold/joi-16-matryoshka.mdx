**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal O((N + Q) \log N)$

First, let's consider a single query - what's the minimum number of dolls left
over? A single nested doll consists of some dolls of increasing $R_i$ and $H_i$.
If we sort the dolls by $H_i$ and only consider their $R_i$, then the answer is
the minimum number of increasing subsequences needed to "cover" all the dolls.

It's well-known that the minimum number of increasing subsequences is equal to
the longest non-increasing subsequence (see
[the LIS module](/gold/lis/#application-2---minimum-number-of-increasing-sequences)
for more details.) This gives us a way to answer a single query in
$\mathcal O(N \log N)$ time!

But what if we need to answer multiple queries?

Since we don't have to answer the queries online, let's sort them in decreasing
order of $A_i$. If $B_i = \infty$ for each query, then we can simply do a line
sweep on the dolls and queries, inserting dolls into the sequence and updating
the longest non-increasing subsequence as we get to them.

For variable $B_i$s, we only want the longest non-increasing subsequence for
some prefixes of the sequence of dolls (not the whole sequence like before). We
can thus binary search on the DP array from finding the longest non-increasing
subsequence to find this answer. This is because the DP array stores, for each
$l$, the doll with the smallest $R_j$ with a non-increasing subsequence ending
on it with length $l$.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

pair<int, int> doll[200000];
pair<pair<int, int>, int> query[200000];
int ans[200000];

int main() {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
	int n, q;
	cin >> n >> q;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> doll[i].first >> doll[i].second;
		doll[i].second = -doll[i].second;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
		cin >> query[i].first.first >> query[i].first.second;
		query[i].second = i;
	}
	sort(doll, doll + n, greater<pair<int, int>>());
	sort(query, query + q, greater<pair<pair<int, int>, int>>());

	vector<pair<int, int>> dp;
	for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < q; i++) {
		while (j < n && doll[j].first >= query[i].first.first) {
			int lds = upper_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(),
			                      make_pair(-doll[j].second, INT_MAX)) -
			          dp.begin();
			if (lds == dp.size())
				dp.push_back({-doll[j].second, doll[j].first});
			else dp[lds] = {-doll[j].second, doll[j].first};
			j++;
		}
		ans[query[i].second] =
		    upper_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(),
		                make_pair(query[i].first.second, INT_MAX)) -
		    dp.begin();
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) cout << ans[i] << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```
