In this problem, Bessie stands on a grid and wants to go from the lower left
corner to upper-right corner in as few moves as possible. An initial idea could
be to model the grid as a graph, where adjacent cells are connected by edges,
and run a BFS to find the shortest path.

However, two additional constraints play a role in this problem: Bessie must be
able to reach the destination regardless of which direction she starts in, and
she can only move in the direction she is facing.

Let's imagine now that there are two cows standing on the cell $(1, 1)$, and
both of them move the same way on each operation. Since $N \leq 20$, we can
modify the original graph to support this new problem. Let's create a new graph
$G'$ as follows:

For each pair of cells in the grid, $(x, y)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, add $16$ nodes in
the graph storing six parameters each:

- $x$ coordinate of cow $a$
- $y$ coordinate of cow $a$
- $x$ coordinate of cow $b$
- $y$ coordinate of cow $b$
- direction of cow $a$
- direction of cow $b$

for all $4 ^ 2$ directions each cow could be facing.

Given this new graph, we add edges between two "states" which are reachable from
each other. For example, if we apply the "turn left" operation, we add an edge
to the state where both cows directions turn left.

On this new graph, we can directly run a BFS, and retrieve the answer at the
state $\{N, N, N, N, x, y\}$ where $x$ and $y$ represent directions.

<Warning>

Don't forget that once Bessie reaches the goal, she will ignore further
commands. In the modified problem, if one of the two cows is at the goal, stop
applying commands to her.
