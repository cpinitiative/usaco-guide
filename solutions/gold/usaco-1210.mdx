## Solution
We can subtract $1$ from $T$ because we will always get the sample test case and add it to our final answer.


Let $E_x$ be the expected value after at most $x$ submissions. We are trying to find $E_K$. To get the expected value of the final submission, we can find the relation between $E_x$ and $E_{x - 1}$.

To do this we can find $E_x$ in terms of $E_{x -1}$ and $p_i$ which is the probability of getting exactly $i$ test cases.

After $x-1$ submissions, you expect to get $E_{x-1}$ test cases. There are three posibilites if you decide to resubmit.

Case 1: If you get less test cases than $E_{x-1}$, you don't want to resubmit.

Case 2: If you get more test cases than $E_{x-1}$, you do want to resubmit.

Case 3: If you get the same number of test cases as $E_{x-1}$, it doesn't matter if you resubmit. In this case it wouldn't hurt to resubmit or stay the same so we can combine this with Case 1 (or Case 2).

The probablity that you get less than or equal to $E_{x-1}$ test cases is ${\sum_{i=0}}^{E_{x - 1}} p_i$. We can multiply this by the $E_{x-1}$ to get the expected value of $E_x$ if we stop before the $x$th submission and we get $E_{x-1} \cdot {\sum_{i=0}}^{E_{x - 1}} p_i$

The probablity that you get more than $E_{x-1}$ test cases is ${\sum_{i=\lfloor E_{x-1} \rfloor + 1}}^T p_i$. The expected value of getting more than $E_{x-1}$ test cases is the sum of $i$ from ${\lfloor E_{x-1} \rfloor + 1}$ to $T$ of the probability of getting $i$ test cases multiplied by $i$ or ${\sum_{\lfloor E_{x-1} \rfloor + 1}}^T p_i i$.

In addition, these formulas for both cases can help us mathematically prove that you can merge Case 3 with either Case 1 or 2. The only difference between both cases is whether the $i = E_{x-1}$ will belong to the first or second summation. If we merge it with Case 1, the term of the summation will become $E_{x-1} \cdot p_{E_{x-1}}$. If we merge it with Case 3, it would also become $E_{x-1} \cdot p_{E_{x-1}}$. This happens because $p_i \cdot E_{x-1} = p_i \cdot i$ is only satisfied when $i=E_{x-1}$.

Adding the two parts gives our final expression for the expected value:

$$E_x = E_{x -1} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor E_{x - 1} \rfloor} p_i + \sum_{i=\lfloor E_{x - 1} + 1 \rfloor}^{T} i p_i$$

We can solve the problem by simulating each test case and recalculating the summations for each test case in $O(TK)$. However, this can easily be sped up to $O(T^2 + K)$ by pre-calculating $p_i$ using Pascal's identity and by precalculating the prefix sums of both $p_i$ and $p_i i$ so we can get the values of the summations in $O(1)$ instead of $O(T)$. This gives us the first $9$ test cases but is not good enough.

In order to fully solve the question, we need to remove the $O(K)$ factor. We can do this if we are able to process multiple values of $E_x$ in a single step.

Claim: We can process multiple queries if the values of ${\sum_{i=0}}^{\lfloor E_{x - 1} \rfloor} p_i$ and ${\sum_{i=\lfloor E_{x - 1} + 1 \rfloor}}^{T} i p_i$ don't change between queries.

Proof:
Let $a = {\sum_{i=0}}^{\lfloor E_{x - 1} \rfloor} p_i$ and $b = {\sum_{i=\lfloor E_{x - 1} + 1 \rfloor}}^{T} i p_i$. Then our formula becomes

$E_x = E_{x - 1} \cdot a + b$

Since $a$ and $b$ are constant, we can extend this formula and get

$E_x = a \cdot (a \cdot ... (a \cdot E_{x - k} + b) ... + b) + b$

Simplifying gives us a geometric sequence.

$E_x = a^k \cdot E_{x - k} + a^{k - 1}b + a^{k - 2} + ... + b$

We can rewrite the second through last term using the formula for a geometric series.

$E_x = a^k \cdot E_{x - k} + \frac{b(a^k - 1)}{a - 1}$

Here is more information about [geometric series](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Geometric_sequence).

However, the values of $a$ and $b$ won't always remain the same. We can binary search on the max number of submissions Bessie can make before the values of $a$ and $b$ change. $a$ and $b$ will change when the value of ${\lfloor E_x \rfloor}$ changes. The conditions for binary search are fullfilled because $E_x$ is a non-decreasing function.

Since there are at most $T$ values of $E_x$, $a$ and $b$ can change at most $T$ times so the resulting time complexity will be $O(T^2 + T \log K)$.

## Implementation
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(T^2 + T \log K)$
