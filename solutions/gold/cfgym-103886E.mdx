## Explanation

A little thing to notice that helps us in the right direction is that a possible
test case can have queries that ask for one specific number, like
```
100 100
```
This motivates a prefix sum approach, where we calculate the answer for each
possible integer and answer queries with a prefix sum array.

To actually count the number of non-palindromic arrays that sum to an integer
(which we'll refer to as $x$ from now on), we can use complimentary counting.

To count the total number of arrays that sum to $x$, *period*, we evaluate
the following summation:
$$
\sum_{l=1}^x \binom{(x-l)+(l-1)}{l-1}
$$
In this summation, we sum over all possible lengths $l$ of the array,
and then use [stars and bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics))
to count how many arrays of length $l$ sum to $x$.
The initial subtraction is to account for that all elements must be positive.

This expression then simplifies to
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{l=1}^x \binom{x-1}{l-1} &= \sum_{l=0}^{x-1} \binom{x-1}{l} \\
&= \boxed{2^{x-1}}
\end{align*}
$$

It remains to count the number of *palindromic* arrays that sum to $x$.
For this, there's two cases to consider: $x$ being even and $x$ being odd.

If $x$ is even, then it's possible to have an even-length palindromic array.
Each half must sum to $\frac{x}{2}$ and since the two are basically identical,
there's $2^{\frac{x}{2}-1}$ possible palindromic arrays of this form.
However, we can also form an odd-length array by taking some even number
from $x$ initially and setting it as the center element.
This gives us a grand total of
$$
1+2^{\frac{x}{2}-1}+\sum_{i=1}^{x/2-1} 2^{(x-2i)/2-1}
$$
The $1$ at the font is another edge case when we put all of $x$ as the middle.
But anyways, notice that this actually simplifies to $2^{\frac{x}{2}}$!
Pretty cool, huh?

If $x$ is odd, though, we can't have an even-length palindromic array.
We can only take an odd amount from $x$ and set it as the center, giving us
$$
1+\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor x/2 \rfloor-1} 2^{(x-2i-1)/2-1}
$$
This also simplifies like the one we did previously, only this time it's to $2^{\frac{x-1}{2}}$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(Q+N)$, where $N$ is the maximum value of $r$.

MOD = 10**9 + 7
MAX_VAL = 10**5

two_pows = [1]
for _ in range(1, MAX_VAL + 1):
	two_pows.append((two_pows[-1] * 2) % MOD)

pref_sums = [0]
for i in range(1, MAX_VAL + 1):
	if i % 2 == 0:
		nonpal_num = (two_pows[i - 1] - two_pows[i // 2]) % MOD
	else:
		nonpal_num = (two_pows[i - 1] - two_pows[(i - 1) // 2]) % MOD
	pref_sums.append((pref_sums[-1] + nonpal_num) % MOD)

for _ in range(int(input())):
	lo, hi = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
	print((pref_sums[hi] - pref_sums[lo - 1]) % MOD)
```
