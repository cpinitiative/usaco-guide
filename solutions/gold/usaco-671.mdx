[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_lasers_gold_dec16.html)

It is optimal to use each fence post at most once, so we can use BFS to find the
minimum number of fence posts needed to direct the laser to the barn. We store
the points on each horizontal and vertical line in $\texttt{lines}$. In the
queue $q$, we store the index of the point and the direction of the incoming
beam. The array $\texttt{dist}$ will store the number of edges of the shortest
path from the laser to each point.

For every element in the queue, we process each unvisited point that the beam
can be deflected to by adding it into the queue and updating its distance as one
more than the current distance.

If we are able to deflect the beam to the barn, the number of mirrors needed is
one less than the distance.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {

	cin >> n;
	vector<pair<int, int>> points(n + 2);
	// lines[0] are vertical, lines[1] are horizontal
	unordered_map<int, vector<int>> lines[2];
	for (int i = 0; i < n + 2; i++) {
		cin >> points[i].first >> points[i].second;
		lines[0][points[i].first].push_back(i);
		lines[1][points[i].second].push_back(i);
	}
	// index of fence post and bool for direction of incoming beam
	// true for horizontal, false for vertical
	queue<pair<int, bool>> q;
	q.push({0, true});
	q.push({0, false});
	// dist[i] is number of edges to reach point i from the laser
	vector<int> dist(n + 2, 1e9);
	dist[0] = 0;
	// BFS to find minimum number of fence posts to direct laser to barn
	while (!q.empty()) {
		int curr = q.front().first;
		bool beamdir = q.front().second;
		q.pop();
		int dir = (beamdir ? 0 : 1);
		int coord = (beamdir ? points[curr].first : points[curr].second);
		for (int point : lines[dir][coord]) {
			if (dist[point] == 1e9) {
				q.push({point, !beamdir});
				dist[point] = dist[curr] + 1;
			}
		}
	}
	cout << (dist[1] == 1e9 ? -1 : dist[1] - 1) << endl;
	return 0;
