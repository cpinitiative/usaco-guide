## Explanation

We do dynamic programming on all subsets of the notes.

Let $\texttt{covered}[S]$ be the maximum prefix of people we can pay off using the notes defined in the subset, and $\texttt{leftover}[S]$ be the leftover amount of money we have after we pay off the prefix of the people.

When transitioning, iterate over all possible "ending" banknotes and see how each of them would fit in when you put them onto the leftovers of the previous subset.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(M2^M)$

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

int main() {
	int people_num;
	int note_num;
	std::cin >> people_num >> note_num;
	vector<int> people(people_num);
	vector<int> banknotes(note_num);
	for (int &p : people) { std::cin >> p; }
	for (int &b : banknotes) { std::cin >> b; }

	vector<int> leftover(1 << note_num, -1);
	vector<int> people_covered(1 << note_num, -1);
	leftover[0] = 0;
	people_covered[0] = 0;
	for (int s = 0; s < (1 << note_num); s++) {
		for (int last = 0; last < note_num; last++) {
			if ((s & (1 << last)) == 0) { continue; }
			int prev = s & ~(1 << last);
			if (people_covered[prev] == -1) { continue; }

			int new_amt = leftover[prev] + banknotes[last];
			// the salary of the current person we're going to try to pay
			int curr_target = people[people_covered[prev]];
			// if it's still not enough, just increment the leftover pile
			if (new_amt < curr_target) {
				people_covered[s] = people_covered[prev];
				leftover[s] = new_amt;
			}
			/*
			 * or it's exactly right, in which case reset the leftover count
			 * and increment the covered amount
			 */
			else if (new_amt == curr_target) {
				people_covered[s] = people_covered[prev] + 1;
				leftover[s] = 0;
			}
		}
		// we've covered all the people!
		if (people_covered[s] == people_num) {
			cout << "YES" << endl;
			return 0;

	cout << "NO" << endl;
