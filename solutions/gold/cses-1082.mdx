$n=10^{12}$ implies that the desired time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt n)$.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Calculating the sum of the divisors for each number from $1$ to $n$ seems to be
impossible- even if it was doable in constant time the solution would still TLE.

What if instead of starting from the numbers, we started from the *divisors*
instead?

<Spoiler title="Solution">

As mentioned in Hint 2, let's start from the divisors instead of the numbers.

If we consider any divisor $d$, notice that it will always occur
$\left\lfloor \frac{n}{d}\right\rfloor$ times if we list out all the divisors
of the numbers from $1$ to $n$.

So now, to get our answer all we have to do is calculate the below expression:
$$
\sum_{d=1}^{n} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{d}\right\rfloor
$$

But calculating this with brute force yields an $\mathcal{O}(n \sqrt{n})$ solution,
which is still too slow.

However, if you list out the values of $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{d}\right\rfloor$ (henceforth referred to as $q$)
for large enough values of $n$, notice that the values start to form long "chains" of the same
value. For example, here's the list of values for $n=20$:
$$
[20, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
$$

Taking this pattern further, it's possible to show that there's at most
$2\sqrt{n}$ distinct values of $q$
(proof [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1069460)).

Knowing this, we can quickly process all terms in the summation with the same value of $q$.
We start with $d=1$ and jump to the next value that yields a different value of $q$
instead of naively increasing it by $1$.
