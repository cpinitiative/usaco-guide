## Explanation

Let's consider $f$ when we've added two equations to it, $\{a, b\}, \{c, d\}$.

1. $$c(ax + b) + d$$
2. $$acx + bc + d$$

From this, we can make two observations.

1. In the expanded equation, $x$ is just multiplied by all of its coefficents.
2. Any constant is multiplied by all future coefficients.

We can calculate all of this on the fly as we process "add" and "compute" queries, but how do we deal with "removal" queries under a modulus?

<Spoiler title="Handling Removal Queries">

We'll compute modular inverses to divide out removed coefficients, and subtract the constant multiplied by our new coefficient.

The bottleneck comes from computing modular inverses, so the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;
const ll MOD = 998244353;

// source: https://usaco.guide/gold/modular#solution---exponentiation
ll bin_exp(ll x, ll n) {
	assert(n >= 0);

	x %= MOD;

	ll res = 1;
	while (n > 0) {
		if (n % 2 == 1) { res = res * x % MOD; }
		x = x * x % MOD;
		n /= 2;
	}
	return res;
}

int main() {
	int q;
	cin >> q;

	ll mult_x = 1;
	ll constant = 0;
	queue<pair<int, int>> f;
	for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
		int type;
		cin >> type;

		if (type == 0) {
			int a, b;
			cin >> a >> b;

			// add to our queue
			f.push({a, b});

			// x will gain a factor of a in the final expansion
			mult_x = (mult_x * a) % MOD;

			/*
			 * any existing constants will be multiplied by a
			 * and b will be multiplied against all future "a"s
			 */
			constant = ((constant * a) % MOD + b) % MOD;
		} else if (type == 1) {
			pair<int, int> x = f.front();
			f.pop();

			// compute modular inverse with exponentation
			ll inv = bin_exp(x.first, MOD - 2);

			mult_x = (mult_x * inv) % MOD;
			constant -= (x.second * mult_x) % MOD;

			if (constant < 0) { constant += MOD; }
		} else if (type == 2) {
			int x;
			cin >> x;

			cout << ((mult_x * x) + constant) % MOD << endl;
		}
	}
}
