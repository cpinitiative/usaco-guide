## Explanation

Since the relation of friends is transitive, we can keep sets in which all the
people in a set are friends. For each of these sets of friends, there will also
be a set of enemies made up of the union of all the enemies of each person in
the set of friends. Every person in this set of enemies will be an enemy of
every person in the set of friends. To see why this is true, consider a person
$a$ in the set of friends $F$. Their enemy is $b$ in the set of enemies $E$.
Since an enemy of a friend is also an enemy, $b$ will be the enemy of all of
$a$'s friends, which are the other people $F$. Furthermore, each person in $E$
is friends with all other people in $E$, since they share a common enemy $a$.

To represent this, sets $0 \dots n - 1$ in the code will be sets of friends,
while each set $i$ in sets $n \dots 2n - 1$ will be be the enemies of set
$i - n$.

For each query, we let the two people be $x$ and $y$ and the root of $x$'s
friends, $y$'s friends, $x$'s enemies and $y$'s enemies be $\texttt{xroot}$,
$\texttt{yroot}$, $\texttt{exroot}$ and $\texttt{eyroot}$, respectively.

### areEnemies

If any of $x$'s friends are friends with any of $y$'s enemies, then $x$ will be
friends with one of $y$'s enemies. Thus, $x$ and $y$ will be enemies. To check
if this is the case, we check if $\texttt{xroot}$ is the same as
$\texttt{eyroot}$ (which means that $x$'s friends are $y$'s enemies), or if
$\texttt{yroot}$ is the same as $\texttt{exroot}$ (which means that $y$'s
friends are $x$'s enemies).

### areFriends

If $x$ and $y$ are in the same set, then they are friends.

### setEnemies

When setting two people as enemies, we need to check if they are friends. We can
use the $\texttt{areFriends}$ function to do this. If they are not friends, we
join $\texttt{xroot}$'s set with $\texttt{eyroot}$'s set and join
$\texttt{yroot}$'s set with $\texttt{exroot}$'s set, since the friend of an
enemy is also an enemy.

### setFriends

If we want to set two people as friends, we first need to check if they are
enemies, using the $\texttt{areEnemies}$ function. If they are not enemies, we
can join $\texttt{xroot}$'s and $\texttt{yroot}$'s sets. The enemies of two sets
of friends will also become friends, so we also join $\texttt{exroot}$'s and
$\texttt{eyroot}$'s sets.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(Q \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $Q$ is the number
of operations
