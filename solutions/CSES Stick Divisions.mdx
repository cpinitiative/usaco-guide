In this problem, we're asked to find the minimum cost to divide a stick with length $x$ into $n$ sticks with given lengths. It helps to work backwards; what if we start with sticks of lengths $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ and merge them into one?

It turns out that this can be solved using [Huffman Coding](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf#page=73) (also see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding#Basic_technique)). The algorithm is simple; take the two shortest sticks, merge them into one, and repeat.

If you're wondering why Huffman Coding always produces an optimal solution, see [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-02-introduction-to-eecs-ii-digital-communication-systems-fall-2012/readings/MIT6_02F12_chap03.pdf#page=6).

## Implementation

In C++, this can be done easily with a [priority queue](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/priority_queue/).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main(){
		ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
		int x, n; cin >> x >> n;
		priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > PQ;
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
			int a; cin >> a;
			PQ.push(a);
		}
		long long ans=0;
		for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
			int a=PQ.top(); PQ.pop();
			int b=PQ.top(); PQ.pop();
			PQ.push(a+b);
			ans += a+b;
		}
		
		cout << ans <<"\n";    
		return 0;
}
```
