When adding an internal solution, you have to update relevant modules to point to this new internal solution. This process is partially automated; modules containing this problem have been updated in the editor (see file list to the left).

## Explanation

(add explanation here ...)

Use `\texttt{}` around variable names with length *greater than one*, like so. Place long equations on separate lines with display math, and use `\cdot` instead of `*` to denote multiplication.

$$
\texttt{arr}[i]=2\cdot (a+b+c+d+e)+\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\texttt{arr}[j]
$$

$\textbf{func(var)}$

$\texttt{func(var)}$

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$

^ Format time complexity like this. Should appear outside of `<LanguageSection>` if it's the same for all implementations.
