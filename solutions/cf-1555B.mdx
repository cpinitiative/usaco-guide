<Info title="Info/Tips">
Oftentimes, problems will try to trick you. For example, since the judge is asking for a double, you would assume you may need to some advanced geometry or some diagonal movements, but a good rule of thumb is to always stay simple: the most elegant and more importantly the fastest solutions are the shortest.

## Explanation

Let's call: 
* $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ the leftmost and rightmost positions of the inital rectangle respectively
* $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ the bottommost and topmost positions of the inital rectangle respectively
* $w_{1}$ and $h_{1}$ the width and height of the inital rectangle (which can be calculated by calulating the difference in x and y)
* $w_{2}$ and $h_{2}$ the width and height of the second rectangle respectively
* $W$ and $H$ the total width and height of the room

More importantly, there are 4 different places the second rectangle could be placed: left, right, top, bottom.
For each place, we can calculate the correct x or y positions in order to just barely fit the second rectangle.

Here's a diagram
![](cf-1555B\PlacementsDiagram.png)

* To put the second rectangle on the left side, we just need to place the first rectangle's leftmost position or $x_{1}$ to at least $w_{2}$.
* To put the second rectangle on the right side, we just need to place the first rectangle's rightmost position or $x_{2}$ to at least $W$ - $w_{2}$
* To put the second rectangle on the top side, we just need to place the first rectangle's highest position or $y_{2}$ to at least $W$ - $w_{2}$
* To put the second rectangle on the bottom side, we just need to place the first rectangle's lowest position or $y_{1}$ to at least $w_{2}$

Note: when placing the second rectangle on the left and right sides, make sure $w_{1} + w_{2} \leq W$, otherwise, the second rectangle won't fit.

Also, when placing the second rectangle on the top and bottom sides, make sure $h_{1} + h_{2} \leq H$, otherwise, the second rectangle won't fit either of them.

Calculate these placements, and chose the one that requires the least distance.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int tc;
	cin >> tc;
	for (int i = 0; i < tc; i++) {
		int total_width, total_height; 
		cin >> total_width >> total_height;
	
		int x1, y1, x2, y2; 
		cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
	
		int w1 = x2 - x1;
		int h1 = y2 - y1;
	
		int w2, h2; 
		cin >> w2 >> h2;

		// Calculating min and max X and Y values needed to fit in their places
		int left_place = w2;
		int right_place = total_width - w2;
		int top_place = total_height - h2;
		int bottom_place = h2;

		// Calculating distance needed to move first rectangle
		int amount_needed_left = max(left_place - x1, 0);
		int amount_needed_right = max(x2 - right_place, 0);
		int amount_needed_top = max(y2 - top_place, 0);
		int amount_needed_bottom = max(bottom_place - y1, 0);
	
		// Checking bounds of the rectangles
		if (w1 + w2 > total_width) {
			amount_needed_left = INT32_MAX;
			amount_needed_right = INT32_MAX;
		}

		if (h1 + h2 > total_height) {
			amount_needed_top = INT32_MAX;
			amount_needed_bottom = INT32_MAX;
		}
	
		// neat trick to get the min out of multiple elements
		int ans = min({
			amount_needed_left, amount_needed_right,
			amount_needed_top, amount_needed_bottom
		});
	
		// if the rectangles can't fit in the bigger rectangles in any way, print -1
		cout << (ans == INT32_MAX ? -1 : ans) << endl;
	}
}
