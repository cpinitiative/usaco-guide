We're opening access to [USACO Guide Groups](/groups) to everyone! Groups is a
learning management system that allows assigning problems, posting
announcements, and tracking progress with a leaderboard. Now, you're able to
create your own group and invite your friends -- go to
[the groups page](/groups) to get started.
