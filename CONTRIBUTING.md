# Contributing

**We're actively looking for a web developer to help add new features to the site. If you're interested in joining the team, send us an email at usacoguide@gmail.com!**

You may find [this live editor](https://usaco.guide/liveupdate) helpful when editing modules. For more information contributing, view our [Contributing module](https://usaco.guide/general/contributing).

- If you're looking to add/modify modules, refer to the `content/` folder.
- If you're looking to add/modify problem solutions, refer to the `solutions/` folder.
- (Almost) all the other files and folders are related to the front-end code.

Content is written in Markdown ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)), custom components, and limited Latex support from [Katex](https://katex.org/).

If you have any questions about how to contribute, feel free to just open a Github issue and a team member will be able to assist you.
