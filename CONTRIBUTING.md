# Contributing

You may find [this live editor](https://usaco.guide/editor) helpful when editing
modules. For more information about contributing, view our
[Contributing module](https://usaco.guide/general/contributing) or our
[docs](docs).

- If you're looking to add/modify modules, refer to the `content/` folder.
- If you're looking to add/modify problem solutions, refer to the `solutions/`
  folder.
- (Almost) all the other files and folders are related to the front-end code.

Content is written in Markdown ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)), custom components,
and limited Latex support from [Katex](https://katex.org/).

If you have any questions about how to contribute, feel free to just open a
Github issue and a team member will be able to assist you.
