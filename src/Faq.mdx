## Q: What is the USACO?

USACO stands for the [USA Computing Olympiad](http://www.usaco.org/).

USACO contests are scored out of $1000$ points. Recent contests each have three
equally weighted problems; that is, each problem is worth
$1000/3 = 333.333 \dots$ points. Each problem has $10 \dots 25$ test cases
weighted equally. For example, if a contest has three problems, and problem 1
has 10 test cases, then you will get $333.333 \dots/10 = 33.333\dots$ points for
each test case that you get correct for problem 1.

At the end of the contest, a "cutoff score" for each division is determined
based on the difficulty of the contest. If your score is above the "cutoff
score" for your division, then you get promoted to the next division.
Historically, the cutoff score has always been a multiple of $50$ points in the
range $600\ldots 850$ (typically $750$).

If you get a perfect score during the contest (ie. you solve all three problems
correctly), then you get an _in-contest promotion_, where you immediately get
promoted to the next division. You can start the next division's contest
whenever you want during the contest window; your four-hour timer resets when
you start the contest.

## Q: What language should I use for USACO?

The most popular languages that USACO supports are C++, Java, and Python. In
general, we recommend the following:

- If you already know one or more of these languages, just use the one you are
  most comfortable with.
- If you don't know any of these languages, you might as well start with C++, as
  C++ users generally don't need to worry as much about their solutions being a
  constant factor too slow. Furthermore, most modules currently lack Java and
  Python support.

Don't overthink choosing a language -- you can always change languages later!

We cover choosing a language in more detail in our
["Choosing a Language"](/general/choosing-lang) module.

## Q: How do I prepare for USACO?

Learn algorithms, do practice problems, and reflect on why you're missing
problems. Make sure you learn from every problem you do, and you'll improve over
time. If you're looking for a guided roadmap to improve at USACO, check out the
[USACO Guide](/) (that's this site!)

If you want to get better at USACO, the key thing is to **do more practice**!

## Q: What's the best resource to get better at USACO?

We made the [USACO Guide](/) specifically to provide high-quality resources to
help people get better at USACO; we encourage you to give it a shot! We also
list [additional resources](/general/resources-cp) that you may find helpful.
Additionally, USACO has its own
[resources page](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=resources).

## Q: I'm stuck. Where can I get help for USACO?

We recommend you go to the
[(unofficial) USACO Forum](https://forum.usaco.guide/) to get help when you're
stuck. Alternatively, you can join the
[(unofficial) USACO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/bessMBe). They
have channels called `#cp-discussion` and `#cp-help` dedicated to questions
about competitive programming.

## Q: When should I read the USACO analyses?

It really comes down to personal preference; there's no right or wrong answer --
do what works for you! With that being said, we've asked numerous top USACO
competitors what they think about this question. This module lists their
thoughts on [how to effectively practice for USACO](/general/practicing).

## Q: Should I implement every problem that I solve?

Usually, yes (unless the problem is significantly too easy for you). Solving
competitive programming problems consists of two parts: coming up with the
algorithm, and implementing the algorithm. You should implement so that you
practice both parts.

## Q: What topics do I need to know for each of the USACO divisions?

While there is no official USACO syllabus, we've compiled topics for each
division from historical contests:

- [USACO Bronze Topics](/bronze)
- [USACO Silver Topics](/silver)
- [USACO Gold Topics](/gold)
- [USACO Platinum Topics](/plat)

## Q: Where can I find more practice problems?

1. The [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) website has problems from 2011 onwards.

   - We provide a list of recent USACO problems (2015 onwards)
     [here](/general/usaco-monthlies).
   - Older USACO problems may be easier than recent USACO contest problems due
     to increases in difficulty.

2. [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/problemset) -- you can search by tag,
   difficulty level, etc.
3. [CSAcademy Archive](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/)
4. For additional sources of problems, check the [contests](/general/contests)
   page.

## Q: What CodeForces rating corresponds to each of the USACO divisions?

CodeForces rating and USACO divisions shouldn't be compared since CF emphasizes
solving problems quickly (5-8 problems under 2 hours time constraint), while
USACO has harder problems and more time (3 problems in 4-5 hours). However, here
are some _very rough_ estimates:

- USACO Bronze competitors are probably \<1300 rated on CF, and Bronze problems
  correspond to 900-1500 rated CF problems.
- USACO Silver competitors are probably 1200-1500 rated on CF, and Silver
  problems correspond to 1200-1900 rated CF problems.
- USACO Gold competitors are probably 1500-1800 rated on CF, and Gold problems
  correspond to 1500-2200 rated CF problems.
- USACO Platinum competitors are probably 1650+ rated on CF, and Platinum
  problems correspond to 1900+ rated CF problems. (Note that at the Platinum
  level there is a _lot_ of variation in CF ratings.)

Again, CF problems and contests are _significantly different_ from USACO!

## Closing Thoughts

We hope you've found this FAQ useful! If you have any additional questions,
please feel free to ask on the [USACO Forum](https://forum.usaco.guide) and
we'll do our best to answer them.

Best of luck on your competitive programming journey!
