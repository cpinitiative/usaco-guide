## How to use the firebase emulator

1. Get the config variables (you must login to firebase first)
   `firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json`
2. `firebase emulators:start`
3. Edit `src/context/FirebaseContext.tsx`: set `shouldUseEmulator` to `true`.

## Development speedup tips

Delete pages/editor.tsx and pages/groups.tsx (or have them return an empty
component). These pages have a lot of dependencies that slow down webpack.

On my personal computer, I have hot reload times of ~1.5 seconds.

To make development even faster, you can take advantage of tailwind incremental
builds (which don't seem to work with the default postcss setup for some
reason).

1. In `gatsby-browser.tsx`, change the css import to `./build.css` instead of
   `./src/styles/main.css`.
2. Run
   `npx cross-env TAILWIND_MODE=watch postcss src/styles/main.css -o build.css --watch`
   (or the equivalent on your platform)
3. Run `gatsby develop`

I get a consistent 1s hot reload with this
